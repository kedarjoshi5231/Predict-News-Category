"According to Ravi Menon, analyst at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, two factors are driving the broadband subscriber base. One is the bundled plans. The second is the network effect where growing usage of internet applications (such as apps) pulls in more users.


This works well for the telecom industry, as bundled packages are generally priced higher than plain vanilla voice plans. But encouraging high data usage also entails high capex, which is why all telcos have been burning a lot of cash. Unless tariffs rise from current levels, the situation is unlikely to improve."

"Analysts cautioned against rising risk to the fiscal consolidation efforts from higher expenditure outlay in the budget


India's 10-year government bond yield rose nearly 10 basis points on Friday as analyst expected government to face challenges in meeting its target for fiscal year 2020 after interim finance minister Piyush Goyal announced tax gift for middle class and cash transfer for farmers ahead of final elections due in May.


An announcement of record borrowing plan at ₹7.04 trillion for fiscal year 2020, higher than ₹6.4 trillion according to Bloomberg estimates, to meet the expenditure targets weighed on bond yields.


The Interim Budget 2019 has not increased the basic exemption limit from ₹2.50 lakh, it has increased tax rebate under Section 87A from ₹2,500 to ₹12,500 and would cover taxpayers having taxable income up to ₹5, 00,000."

"Traditionally, Bundelkhand has been a bastion of the SP-BSP but in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP on its lofty development promise of acche din, swept the elections winning all four seats, polling 44.86% votes. Since the region is small, there is always a possibility of a swing in favour of one or another party. The question is, will BJP be able to retain its hold on Bundelkhand?


In 2019, electoral arithmetic has changed with the alliance of SP and BSP. In 2014 the SP-BSP’s combined vote was only 100,000 less than BJP’s which is a very thin margin and since they are contesting together, it may adversely affect the chances of the BJP.


However, BJP supporters are confident of the party’s victory once again in the name of Modi and the developmental projects like Bundelkhand Expressway, Bundelkhand Development Board, Defence Corridor from Jhansi to Agra, ₹9,000 crore piped water supply scheme for drinking water, and Amrit Yojana for Jhansi district."

"RT cores enable real-time ray tracing of objects and environments resulting in physically accurate shadows, reflections and a superior visual experience. Ray tracing works by tracing the path of individual light rays in a 3D scene.


When the light ray bounces from one object to another it causes reflections, when blocked by objects it causes shadows, and when it passes through transparent objects the light ray causes refractions. Processing and reproducing these finer nuances in real-time scenarios, such as games, require a lot of graphical power. Combined with RT-Cores and dedicated ray tracing acceleration hardware, RTX GPUs enable real-time ray tracing in games. In a nutshell, this will lead to more realistic visuals during games."
"Facebook confirmed labelers in Timisoara, Romania and Manila, the Philippines are involved in the same project.


Among Facebook's other labeling projects, one worker in Hyderabad for outsourcing vendor Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp said he and at least 500 colleagues look for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos.


The aim is to train an automated Facebook tool that enables advertisers to avoid sponsoring videos that are, for example, adult or political, Facebook said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.


Another application of labeling involved the social network's Marketplace shopping feature, where it automated category recommendations for new listings by first having labelers and product experts categorize some existing listings, Facebook's Mathur said.


At Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user's friends. That ensures the sample reflects the range of activity on Facebook and Instagram, said Karen Courington, director of product support operations at Facebook.


""We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys,"" the policy states.


Europe's GDPR also requires companies delete user data upon request. Facebook said it has technology to routinely sync labeled posts with both deletion requests and changes to content privacy settings.


Facebook and other companies are testing techniques to curtail the need for outsourced labeling, in part to analyze more data faster and cheaper. For instance, AI training data for news feed rankings and photo descriptions for the blind came from hashtags on Instagram posts, Facebook's Mathur said."

Britain called for a first-of-its-kind watchdog for social media that could fine executives and even ban companies


A EU parliamentary committee approved a bill giving internet companies an hour to remove terror-related material or face fines in billions


London: Tech giants like Facebook and Google came under increasing pressure in Europe on Monday when countries proposed stricter rules to force them to block extreme material such as terrorist propaganda and child porn.


Britain called for a first-of-its-kind watchdog for social media that could fine executives and even ban companies. And a European Union parliamentary committee approved a bill giving internet companies an hour to remove terror-related material or face fines that could reach into the billions.


""We are forcing these firms to clean up their act once and for all,"" said British Home Secretary Sajid Javid, whose department collaborated on Britain's proposal.


Opponents warned the British and EU measures could stifle innovation and strengthen the dominance of technology giants because smaller companies won't have the money to comply. That, in turn, could turn Google and Facebook into the web's censors, they said.


The push to make the big companies responsible for the torrent of material they carry has largely been driven by Europeans. But it picked up momentum after the March 15 mosque shootings in New Zealand that killed 50 people and were live-streamed for 17 minutes. Facebook said it removed 1.5 million videos of the attacks in the 24 hours afterwards."

Other than these specifications, the new OnePlus smartphones are expected to come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset paired with a 5G-enabled X55 modem.

An analysis of district-wise voting patterns based on aggregation of vote shares of Assembly segments that lie in a district shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) polled more votes than any other party in the 2014 elections in roughly half (60) of the 123 districts with relatively high internet penetration.

"While oil prices have receded to about $72.15 a barrel, it must be noted that they are about 34% higher so far this year. The rise in oil comes against the backdrop of unimpressive corporate results, low job creation, a slowdown in domestic consumption, fears of a subpar monsoon and muted private sector capital expenditure (capex).


Election-related nervousness has kept Indian equities volatile. Even so, the S&P Nifty 50 index has increased by about 8.21% so far this year.


Clearly, there are many domestic headwinds that the economy is battling. But first, what about the outlook on oil prices?

Sujay Vikhe Patil’s move to the BJP shifts much of the political power in the district to the party. The move “signified a power shift in the district and reflected the winds of change sweeping the country"" under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, Fadnavis said."

"The other problem that needs to be solved is the ability to pay. Do we have the right ecosystem investments happening to ensure that people can pay if they want to? That’s where a lot of our efforts are. In India, we now have carrier billing, gift cards, digital codes with Paytm, etc. And that’s translating into high wire growth across a lot of titles.


Soni: We are working with all options. This is an important area for us, to make sure we have a best in class commerce platform. So, yes, UPI, wallets and all those options are being evaluated and you’ll hear more as those things are ready for launch.


In the global scheme, there’s a lot of focus on AR/VR space. So, when you look at developers who are coming here, do you have special focus on the guys who are working with AR/VR and other future facing apps/games?


Soni: We support innovation in all shapes and forms. Innovation can be something very simple, it doesn’t have to be AR/VR led. As long as it’s meaningful for the audience, it works. At the same time, if there are developers who want to push the boundaries, absolutely, we equip them with the resources and documentation that they need to create such content.


We’ve got market experts and global teams across the world that can provide very hands-on market expertise to developers and we can connect them to the developers."
"“We were just trying to get it to work,"" recalled Cerf, who is now Google’s chief internet evangelist. “But now that it’s in the hands of the general public, there are people who...want it to work in a way that obviously does harm, or benefits themselves, or disrupts the political system. So we are going to have to deal with that.""


Contrary to futuristic fears of “super-intelligent"" robots taking control, the real dangers of our tech era have crept in more prosaically — often in the form of tech innovations we welcomed for making life more convenient .


Part of experts’ concern about the leap into connecting every home device to the internet and letting computers do our work is that the technology is still buggy and influenced by human errors and prejudices. Uber and Tesla were investigated for fatal self-driving car crashes in March, IBM came under scrutiny for working with New York City police to build a facial recognition system that can detect ethnicity, and Amazon took heat for supplying its own flawed facial recognition service to law enforcement agencies.


In some cases, opposition to the tech industry’s rush to apply its newest innovations to questionable commercial uses has come from its own employees. Google workers helped scuttle the company’s Pentagon drone contract, and workers at Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce sought to cancel their companies’ contracts to supply tech services to immigration authorities.


“It became obvious to a lot of people that the rhetoric of doing good and benefiting society and ‘Don’t be evil’ was not what these companies were actually living up to,"" said Whittaker, who is also a research scientist at Google who founded its Open Research group.


At the same time, even some titans of technology have been sounding alarms. Prominent engineers and designers have increasingly spoken out about shielding children from the habit-forming tech products they helped create.


And then there’s Microsoft President Brad Smith, who in December called for regulating facial recognition technology so that the “year 2024 doesn’t look like a page"" from George Orwell’s “1984."""
"The OnePlus 7 Pro is reported to have appeared on a benchmarking database along with some key specifcations.

The Chinese company has been consistently pushing out teasers and interacting with the media to put an end to all the speculations and rumours, now that the launch of the smartphone is only a couple of weeks away.

"Zuckerberg’s privacy push also led to a redesign of the company’s main social network, unveiled at F8, to focus on groups and communities — a shift from the open-sharing model he built the company around. The irony wasn’t lost on Zuckerberg.


“I get that a lot of people aren’t sure that we’re serious about this,"" Zuckerberg said. “I know that we don’t exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly. But I’m committed to doing this well, and to starting a new chapter for our products.""


End-to-end encryption of messaging products means that Facebook and other businesses won’t be able to access the content of those messages, but some analysts say that chat content isn’t valuable for advertising targeting anyway. Secure messaging is also difficult to implement, and “there are a lot of places where the company could deliver something that does not live up to end-to-end encryption’s security and privacy guarantees,"" said Gennie Gebhart, associate director of research at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.


At the same time, Facebook’s efforts to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger increases the value of the data the company has on users because it gleans more data points on each person."

"But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks, citing ""cross-currents"" such as slowing growth overseas and the longest federal government shutdown in history that just ended.


That clearly indicates the Fed will adopt a cautious approach this year following four rate increases in 2018, a view held by a majority of economists in a separate Reuters poll.


""It seems that the 2018 playbook of the dollar strength – U.S. growth out performance, continued Fed rate hikes, and tighter liquidity conditions from the balance sheet – is reversing,"" noted strategists at Morgan Stanley.


""Forward-looking U.S. data such as business and consumer confidence suggest a slowing domestic economy, and the shift in Fed rhetoric suggests that rates will be lower and the balance sheet larger than previously thought. This is a recipe for dollar weakness.""


The latest poll once again predicted most major currencies will strengthen against the dollar in the year ahead.


But any significant gains for other currencies will likely be limited. A synchronized global economic slowdown is already under way, keeping major central banks on the sidelines."

Similarly, Xiaomi introduced a affordable but good smart TVs this year, while myriad companies are selling smart lights, plugs and more.

Now, keeping innovations aside, what about the practicality of features? In the Indian market, there are several people not comfortable with the omission of the headphone jack, as it is easier to find a wired headset than a Bluetooth one. Yet, you skipped on it in the Eluga X1 and X1 Pro. Why go for that?


We removed the headphone jack on the Eluga X1 and X1 Pro for a cleaner and minimalistic design. But, yes— the practicality of the product is very, very important. This time we launched the product to understand the usage and perception of our customers. But our new devices that will replace the Eluga X1 and X1 Pro will come with a headphone jack. It makes more sense to provide those things in our devices."

Let’s accept it—PC gaming on the cheap is difficult. Finding the right gaming mouse, mousepad, keyboard and headphones for you online can take quite a bit of time. And once you’ve fixed your crosshairs on suitable peripherals, you’ll realise they are all of different brands.


SoundBot, an American audio accessory maker, is trying to change that with its SportsBot SS302 4-in-1 combo. It’s a one-stop gaming solution comprising a gaming keyboard, gaming mouse, mousepad and even a pair of gaming headphones. All of this at a price of just ₹ 3,499 and if you buy it off Amazon right now, you can get it for as low as ₹ 2,999, which means the average price of every single unit in the box comes at just ₹ 750.


The unboxing experience is straightforward—a mouse, mousepad, keyboard and a pair of headphones encased in cardboard boxes with the typical smell of ABS plastic. The keyboard and headphones come in silver and look extremely flashy. The mouse has a soft touch texture overall but the forward, backward and DPI adjustment switches have the same ABS plastic present on the keyboard."

"The stellar growth saw India uprooting the US as the world’s second largest mobile phone market by volume -- ranking behind China but handset prices have been skewed towards lower-end of the market. “This is likely to change fast. We expect that mid-range smartphones, those with wholesale prices in the range of $200-400, will grow 20 per cent year-on-year in 2018 and by almost four times during the next five years to make it one of the most important smartphone segments,"" Counterpoint Research Associate Director Tarun Pathak told PTI.


He said the sales volume sweet spot is moving from sub-$150 segment towards mid-tier as many features and capabilities common among flagship models, progressively diffuse through to these lower price bands. Also, with features like full-screen displays, dual-cameras, biometric security and support for artificial intelligence being made available in more mid-range devices, customers don’t seem to mind paying more for the latest technologies. The 4G feature phones -- designed to bring new users online -- continued to gain traction among users during 2018 with Reliance Jio making a strong push for these devices.


Xiaomi, which held onto the numero uno spot in a hyper-competitive market, said it expects the average selling increasing gradually. The company has already expanded its product range to include televisions and said it will continue to focus on bringing more categories and more innovative products to India. Premium players like OnePlus and Apple also expect strong growth in sales in 2019.


OPPO, which has recently set up a research and development facility in India, is focussed on localising products and creating consumer centric devices for consumers in the coming year. The Chinese player, much like its peers, expects the premium segment market to grow and shape out well in 2019.


For Transsion -- which operates multiple brands in India including itel, Infinix and Tecno -- the ₹ 7,000-15,000 segment of smartphones is expected to contribute highest in 2019. Globally, new innovations like 5G and even foldable screens are trends that consumers are keenly awaiting. However, it may be some time before new gadgets with these new features make inroads in the Indian market. Interestingly, high demand -- coupled with increased customs duties -- prompted many vendors to ramp up production in the country.

Some 46 percent of fund managers find corporate balance sheets to be over-leveraged, the survey found, and 51 percent of investors want companies to use cash flow to improve their balance sheets. That's the highest percentage since July 2009.


Europe, one of investors' least-favoured regions, showed a slight improvement. A net 5 percent reported being overweight euro zone stocks, from 11 percent underweight last month.


But investors' reported intention to own European stocks in the next year dropped to six-year lows as the profit outlook for the region continued to lag.


Allocations to UK stocks increased slightly from last month but the UK remained investors' ""consensus underweight"", BAML said. It has been so since February 2016.

"While virtual reality immerses the user in a digital realm, AR overlays visuals and data onto a view of the real world. Use cases include looking at a building and displaying details of the structure beside the image, or listing repair instructions for a mechanic while she works on a defective machine. It’s been touted as having wider mass-market appeal than VR, and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has talked up its prospects.


The 2020 iPhone camera may be a prelude to an AR headset that Apple has been preparing for as early as 2020. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s plans, which could change.


Apple previously aimed to put the new 3-D camera system on the back of this year’s high-end iPhones, but delayed that, the people familiar also said. Still, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant is doubling down on camera capabilities for its handsets.


For 2019, Apple plans successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max -- code-named D42 and D43 -- and an update to the iPhone XR, said the people. The larger of the new high-end iPhones will have three cameras on the back, and other handsets could eventually come with the upgraded system, too, the people said.


Cameras have become one of the most-important features in a saturated smartphone market. Better photos are a compelling reason for people to upgrade their handsets, especially when other new capabilities are either harder to design or too wonky for most customers to appreciate. Apple pioneered smartphone camera improvements, which over the years have included additions like Portrait Mode. Rivals have tried to catch up, with Samsung Electronics Co. launching phones with as many as four outward-facing cameras last year."
"Analysts recall that in September 2015, the all-India average price of cement was increased by ₹7-8 per 50kg bag, led by substantial price hikes in the northern and central markets.


Had the sector been in its glory days, price increases would not have been a big deal. In the current context, though, even if companies resort to further hikes, analysts are sceptical about such prices sustaining. If prices don’t sustain higher, cement margins may remain under pressure for a few more quarters."

Both parties are in an unofficial alliance, and Owaisi in his campaigns has asked the public to vote for Rao during his campaigns in the Lok Sabha and 2018 assembly elections.

Further, since the display also accounts for most of the phone’s battery usage, two displays running two different sets of apps at the same time will not only require more processing speeds but more battery power too.


“Then there is the question of what value the second screen adds, in comparison to bendable screens, which allow users to switch from a 4-inch to an 8-inch screen,"" IDC’s Singh points out.

On 22 April, the Supreme Court directed the Madras high court to decide on a plea in the hearing scheduled for 24 April, failing which it said the order would stand vacated. The Madras high court, after hearing a plea from ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, reversed its 3 April decision.


While the ban has been lifted, the app wasn’t available on the Apple and Google app stores at the time of publishing this story.

"Until Punjab in 2017, Congress was unable to win an assembly election on its own. The first bright spot under Rahul Gandhi’s leadership came in December last year when Congress defeated BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. It will be interesting to see if Congress carries the momentum to the Lok Sabha elections.


This election will also test Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s influence. In the past, Gandhi Vadra has only worked in the Gandhi bastions of Amethi and Rae Bareli. This time, she is overseeing eastern UP, the stronghold of both Modi and state’s chief minister Yogi Adityanath.


Senior party leaders are aware that this election is a do or die battle for Gandhi. “We were down and out in 2014. It took us four years to defeat BJP in some states,"" said a senior party leader from UP. “This election is a survival test for us, for the new leadership and for the new ideas that we have brought to the fore. We either perform or perish.""


Supporters believe that if Gandhi wins both Wayanad and Amethi, he will leave the latter for his sister to contest in a by-election. The younger sibling has spent a lot of time in Amethi and is a popular leader.


“Irani had narrowed the gap in 2014. Gandhi retained the seat despite a Modi wave. Irani has made a dent and it would be interesting to see which way the fight goes. I think Gandhi has the edge because the loyalty factor is still intact,"" said Shashikant Pandey, professor in the department of political science at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Central University, Lucknow.


He agrees that Amethi is symbolic of the challenge Congress faces nationally. The party has been decimated in UP. Amethi is synonymous with Rahul Gandhi, so winning here is critical. But even if he loses, it is not the end of road for either him or Congress,"" Pandey said. “Many heavyweights, including his grandmother, have lost pocket boroughs and then returned stronger."""

"Two years and a slew of anti-heroic roles later, Khanna made his first big splash with Raj Khosla’s Mera Gaon Mera Desh


 (Who would have thought?) Many critics have interpreted Khanna’s much-feared Jabbar Singh as a precursor to the terror-striking Gabbar Singh, Amjad Khan’s iconic turn as a sadistic spaghetti Western baddie in Sholay (1975)


Despite his smouldering good looks and the only voice that could match Bachchan’s, fame did not come instantly to Khanna


 The great Sunil Dutt, who was known for spotting a star when he saw one, indeed picked the right face in Khanna for Man Ka Meet but not necessarily in the right role


 One wonders what made him think of Khanna, who in the coming years would amass a following among audiences as a sexy beast, as your average anti-hero? This man was as heroic and leading-man material as Amitabh Bachchan himself, equally larger than life and a linchpin of memorable 1970s masala hits


 The 1970s was a decade of Amitabh Bachchan but also a decade of Vinod Khanna, Shashi Kapoor, Shatrughan Sinha and Rishi Kapoor


 Seeing their interviews today, as they recollect the heyday, you get a feeling that beneath the healthy rivalry there was a layer of warm friendship that helped lit up their best-known hits


 Be it Hera Pheri, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Amar Akbar Anthony or Parvarish, Khanna and Bachchan were an invincible duo who, between them, share some of the 1970s’ finest cinematic moments"
"There was a time when only Russia was with us on the international stage, while the rest of the world was with Pakistan. After five years, only China is with Pakistan and the rest of the world is with India.


As far as India is concerned, India knows very well that the BJP government and Modi have a zero tolerance policy against terrorism. Even after Uri, I publicly said that my soldiers' blood will not go in vain. After Pulwama, I said that they made a big mistake.


The action that followed was the desire of the common people. As far as fight against terrorism is concerned, Pulwama or before Pulwama, even when I was the chief minister or now, both the BJP and I have same view.


Pakistan has not changed. Do you think that there is no possibility of dialogue with Pakistan and talks will take place only on international forums?


See, when I was not even the prime minister, (when) I had not taken the oath, I had called the prime minister of Pakistan to attend the oath ceremony, only for the sake of our country, (despite) knowing of the reaction of the BJP and its supporters. I had given a message that ""yes, we will go to a decisive stage"". After that I went to Lahore.


So, why does the world believe me? The world has seen that Modi has taken initiatives to shake hands. I wanted to explain to the world that it was me who went ahead on the path of friendship, and I am also fully prepared to tackle any hostility. The world trusts Modi. Pakistan did try very hard, but I put it in the dock.


Arab countries have made their point of view clear, but China remains hostile. Do you think more needs to be done with the neighbours?


See, each country has its own independent strategy. On certain issues we are with Iran and on some issues we are with Arab countries. On some issues we are with Israel and on some issues with Palestine. India's foreign policy is in the interest of India.


As far as bilateral relations between India and China are concerned, we have mutual understanding as well as differences. There are differences, there is acceptability also. But we will not allow differences to become disputes. Despite a border dispute, we have a political relationship, we respect each other. We invest in each other’s places.


Whenever there is a problem at the higher level, the solution also happens. Therefore, multilateral issues should not spoil the bilateral relationships.


There is nothing controversial about it. If the media of this country is unbiased, then it is its responsibility to question the Congress on the issue of national security.


The leader of the 125-year-old Congress speaks without any proof or basis. The Supreme Court has said and so has the CAG, the French parliament, the French president, the company, and the Indian government and the Indian parliament.


Those who abuse the army chief, term the army “rapist"", does it behove them? India has made maximum contribution to peacekeeping mission forces. They go across the globe, but neither the United Nations nor any other country has raised questions on the discipline, conduct or behaviour of our forces. Not even a single word. (But) you are defaming the army of my country.


There is a feeling of abhorrence towards the army; secondly, there is the burden to absolve his father of his sins. That is why when George Fernandes was there (as the defence minister), they had raised corruption in a defence deal. The matter related to coffins. During the UPA government itself the matter ended in court. You cannot clear your father’s sins by leveling false allegations.


If the country’s citizens repose faith in you once again, then what will be the first thing that you are going to do?


I have toured about 70-80% states since elections were announced. I have never seen such a pro-incumbency wave during Gujarat elections nor such a wave in 2013-14. The wave I am seeing today is bigger. Earlier they said it was an undercurrent but the wave is very much visible, it is not a mere vibration.


The way people are joining the BJP, from all over, be it Odisha or West Bengal, the wave is very much visible. This is symbolic enough, which is why your question is improper. Our government will indeed be formed. It is going to be a full majority government. The BJP will get more numbers than earlier.


Not just the BJP, even allies of the BJP will get more numbers than before. And they will come from each and every corner of India.


A glorious government will be formed, and what will be the first decision, or the second decision, for that we shall meet again soon.


This is a question not to the prime minister but to the person that is Narendra Modi. A dedicated person, a self-serving one, a politician, and now someone holding India’s highest office. You underwent a certain mental transformation during each role. How do you see this journey?


In any family if a child doesn’t undergo all-round development, the mind doesn’t develop according to the age, then the child becomes a liability to the family. If he is a part of an organisation, he becomes a liability for that particular organisation.


After becoming the prime minister, if I hadn’t accepted the thought that India can grow large globally, then I wouldn’t have been able to make India so popular in the world.


If I had not moved from here, and remained in slumber throughout, then I wouldn’t have thought I could send a man into space in Gaganyaan.


I am giving you this interview, but more than that I'm trying to read the country through your questions.


I am multitasking. I am sitting in front of you like a student, and learning a lot from it. I am continuously evolving and wish the same for everyone. And then there are certain people who grow in age but don’t evolve."

Even the Shiv Sena won Mumbai South, which has a large non-Marathi population, by nearly 130,000 votes, thanks to the Modi wave, and Mumbai North West by nearly 180,000 votes.

A BJP strategist, who did not want to be named, conceded the point about “anti-incumbency"" but pointed out that even those constituencies where the candidates were relatively unpopular had seen “huge and energetic turnout"" for Modi rallies. “That means the Modi factor is working in even those constituencies,"" he added."

"In a blog post and a Washington speech, Smith painted a bleak vision of all-seeing government surveillance systems forcing dissidents to hide in darkened rooms “to tap in code with hand signals on each other’s arms.""


To avoid such an Orwellian scenario, Smith advocates regulating technology so that anyone about to subject themselves to surveillance is properly notified. But privacy advocates argue that’s not enough.


Such debates are already happening in states like Illinois, where a strict facial recognition law has faced tech industry challenges, and California, which in 2018 passed the nation’s most far-reaching law to give consumers more control over their personal data. It takes effect in 2020.


The issue could find new attention in Congress next year as more Republicans warm up to the idea of basic online privacy regulations and the incoming Democratic House majority takes a more skeptical approach to tech firms that many liberal politicians once viewed as allies — and prolific campaign donors.

"Leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, while welcoming increased participation of women in politics, cautioned that it should not be restricted to being an election gimmick.


“This empowerment of women needs to be done beyond election time and needs to happen on a day-to-day basis. But we need to start somewhere,"" said Congress spokesperson Khushboo Sundar. “We should not use this as a political gimmick for brownie points. The women’s reservation bill should be revived, but that has not happened in the last five years even though the BJP is in majority in Parliament.""


“BJP has always supported the idea of women’s reservation bill and more women joining politics. It has been part of the BJP manifesto. As a policy of BJP, at least 33% of organizational posts are given to women,"" said a senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity. “Empowerment of women is a major issue for the party and it is not limited to politics only.""


Reservation of 33% for women in panchayati raj institutions was made mandatory after a constitutional amendment in 1993. According to the panchayati raj ministry, 19 states, including Bihar and Odisha, have increased that reservation to 50%.


“The move will certainly have a positive impact. As women voters are increasing, women’s representation in politics should also increase.

"Conrad Sangma, the NPP supremo and chief minister of Meghalaya, led the anti-CAB campaign. There were expectations that the CAB would be placed before the Rajya Sabha before the government’s tenure ended. But the BJP surprised all by putting the CAB on hold. The anti-CAB forces celebrated what they thought was their victory, and Conrad Sangma became an urban legend. But holding back the Bill hasn’t sufficiently allayed the fears of the tribal minorities in the region who foresee a deluge of Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh, numbering 12 million.


It is through this prism that one must view the electoral battle lines that are getting drawn in the North-East. The BJP, and its general secretary and chief organizer in the North-East Ram Madhav have enough political acumen to understand how torturous it is to enter the hearts and minds of the predominantly tribal, north-eastern states, especially in the backdrop of the recent anti-CAB protests. The BJP has therefore worked out its electoral plans very astutely by forming alliances with the regional parties, which makes better political sense. It is easier for the people of Meghalaya, for instance, to say they are voting for the NPP than to say upfront that they are voting for the BJP. People have learnt to identify the BJP with its Hindutva agenda and, more specifically, the beef ban and the lynching associated with those who are seen carrying beef or eating it. As tribes, they already feel hemmed in by their minority status, and as Christians, they consider it a double whammy to be under the BJP rule.


The only state which may fall outside this broad categorization is perhaps Arunachal Pradesh, which plays politics a bit differently from the rest. In that state, members of legislative assembly (MLAs) can switch allegiances overnight without any qualms. Their dependence on the ruling government at Delhi is so acute that they don’t see why political ethics should deter them from straddling different political formations. Ideology, they say, makes no sense in politics. So, defections are common. After a tumultuous period in the Arunachal Pradesh legislature, which also had stints of President’s rule for 24 days between January and February 2016 followed by the suicide of then chief minister Kalikho Pul in August 2016, Pema Khandu, the present chief minister who was with the People’s Party of Arunachal, joined the BJP with 33 MLAs in January 2017. Khandu continues as the chief minister till date and the BJP has a total of 47 MLAs in the assembly, including the speaker. The Congress had three MLAs of which two left and joined the BJP. This is par for the course in Arunachal Pradesh.


The BJP’s hatchet man in the North-East, Himanta Biswa Sarma who is known to be an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) disciple, is also a shrewd game changer. He started what is known as the North-East Democratic Alliance on 24 May 2016 after the Assam state assembly elections were declared on 13 May 2016. In the elections, the BJP upstaged the Congress which had been ruling Assam for 15 years. The BJP won 60 of the 126 seats; it’s coalition partner the AGP got 14 seats; and the other pre-poll partner, Bodoland People’s Front, won 12 seats. This laid the foundation for the BJP’s expansionist plans in the North-East, which soon became most apparent in Tripura.


In the Lok Sabha polls of 2014, the BJP in Tripura was not even a factor to reckon with. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM, won both seats. By 2018, when Tripura went to the polls for the state assembly elections, the BJP managed to win 36 seats while its ally the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) won eight seats. The CPM was reduced to 16 seats and the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Congress didn’t win any seat. The BJP then ensured Sunil Deodhar, the RSS pracharak who spent several years working in the rural areas of Meghalaya and speaks the local language fluently, was planted in Tripura to further the BJP’s expansionist policy. It is unimaginable how the Left bastion not only collapsed, but the BJP actually stormed the Bastille. What is surprising is that the IPFT has decided to go it alone in the Lok Sabha polls and has what it calls a “friendly fight"" with the BJP, which has announced its own candidates. It is highly likely that both seats from that state would go the BJP way, more so because the CAB that created tremors in the other six was something that the substantial non-tribal section of Tripura wants in order to legitimize the large number of Bengali Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh."
"The court was hearing a plea filed by 21 opposition leaders, led by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu


It was not the question of ""casting aspersions"", rather a matter of ""satisfaction"" of the electorate, the top court said


NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Monday favoured increasing the random physical verification of VVPAT slips in the upcoming Lok Sabha and assembly polls and told the EC that ""no institution should insulate itself from improvement, including the judiciary"".


It was not the question of ""casting aspersions"", rather a matter of ""satisfaction"" of the electorate, the top court said.


It asked the EC to file response as to whether it can increase the number of sample surveys of VVPAT slips from one in each assembly segment for the upcoming general and assembly elections.


The court was hearing a plea filed by 21 opposition leaders, led by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, seeking that VVPAT slips of at least 50 per cent of voting machines in each assembly constituency be checked randomly in the Lok Sabha elections next month.


A bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Deepak Gupta asked the EC to file its reply on affidavit indicating the reasons of its satisfaction that purity of elections can be maintained and is being maintained."
"Tough action against terrorism emanating from Pakistan, accelerating economic growth and development, and creating job opportunities were the major poll planks of the BJP in the run-up to the 2014 elections.


It was not as though Modi began on an adversarial note with Pakistan. There were several attempts to restart peace talks with Pakistan. But now India is “maintaining diplomatic ties but as a channel of formal communication. Pakistan is still in a denial mode on terrorism,"" Sibal said. “I don’t see much role of dialogue and diplomacy in our relations with Pakistan, unless Pakistan makes some realistic fundamental choices"" such as abandoning terrorism as an instrument of state policy, he said.


On the internal security front, the Modi government’s report card shows hits and misses, said former home secretary G.K. Pillai. “In the case of left-wing extremism, there has been an improvement in the situation,"" he said.


In India’s restive North-east, New Delhi has been able to conclude a broader peace pact with a faction of the Naga rebels in 2015 though since then, little progress has been reported on the details of the pact, Pillai said. Infrastructure development in the region, which borders China, Myanmar and Bangladesh, has picked up, he said. However, the attempt by the Modi government to bring in the Citizenship Bill that aims to protect those seeking shelter in India because of religious persecution or fear of persecution in their home countries and has been opposed by states such as Assam served to trigger unrest in the region, Pillai said.


In Kashmir too, there has been a spike in discontent with the state being administered by the governor following the pullout of the BJP from the People’s Democratic Party-led government in June, Pillai said. “I think the (Modi) government should focus more on improving the situation inside Kashmir,"" he said.

"Several factors may be responsible for de-densification and resultant expansion. One of the main reasons for this development in American cities is the availability of cheap fuel. The repeated cycle of densification and de-densification continues as cities expand spatially. Irrespective of the country, what is evident is that urban sprawl negatively impacts a city’s sustainable growth.


Cities around the world have used various strategies to address this sprawl. While Portland (Oregon, US) has set a city boundary to stop peri-urban areas mushrooming, other cities have taken a transit-oriented approach to reinstate densities. Curitiba (Brazil) has initiated a land-use programme channelling development around bus rapid transit corridors. Several new cities in China have built metro transit lines before settlements, to encourage transit-oriented growth.


Mobility is a factor of growth and pride for many cities. In India, this is evidenced by the focus on metro rail development, from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad, and embodied by the value of Mumbai’s suburban rail or Delhi’s impressive transit network.


Secondly, it is critical to recognize the evolution of the city resident. A generation that carries mobile phones with a GPS unit and has constant data connectivity has a different reverence for time and changing expectations of the physical environment. The cost attached to the commute is not to the liking of the new-age city resident.


The 2011 Census, conducted before the rise of digitized shared mobility in India, found that 77% of all work trips in urban India are by sustainable mobility modes—bus (16.3%), cycle (18.7%), walk (32.3%), intermediate public transport (4.3%), train (5%), and other modes (1.2%). The remaining 23% is by private vehicles: two-wheelers (18.2%) and cars (3.9%). From a user perspective, this can be simplified into three modes: high effort (cycle, walk); medium effort (drive); low effort (ride).


Urban sprawl has long been associated with an aspiration for ‘the drive’. ‘The drive’, whether self-driven or chauffeured, is a function of person, driver and personal vehicle. Regardless of where you sit, personal vehicles require mental effort and physical space like parking spots for many underutilized hours a day. This under-utilization of the personal vehicle brings a huge cost to both cities and citizens."

"Among electronics companies, Samsung is using around 80 Epson robots in its new manufacturing plant in Noida. In the banking sector, ICICI Bank has also deployed their robots in 14-15 locations across India where currency notes are sorted, said Epson’s Satyanarayana.


Bangalore-based SME Suparna Plastics Ltd. which makes plastic ball valves is using SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robots in its assembly operations for the high speed and accuracy it brings to the table. “Instead of taking the conventional way and hire more skilled workers we went for automation using robots. Labour cost is one of the main contributing factors to the cost price of the end product. Robots have helped us bring down the labour cost,"" says Arun Bhat, director, Suparna Plastics Ltd.


In the case of ICICI Bank, currencies collected from various branches are brought to locations where they are grouped, inspected, counted and redistributed to ATM machines or other branches, based on their condition. If the notes are soiled or very old, the ATM machine will have trouble identifying them and will have to be sent to the bank. Once the machines used by the bank have determined the condition of the notes and where they are supposed to go, robots pick up the notes, put them in the counter for counting followed by strapping and then place them in the appropriate slot."
"In other key findings, 97% IT managers admitted that security expertise is one of the greatest issues in India, and while 92% Indian IT managers wish they had a stronger team in place to properly detect, investigate and respond to security incidents, 89% believe cyber security recruitment is a challenge.


14% of IT managers who were victim to one or more cyber attacks last year can’t pinpoint how the attackers gained entry, and 17% don’t know how long the threat was in the environment before it was detected, according to the survey. To improve this lack of visibility, IT managers need endpoint detection and response (EDR) technology that exposes threat starting points and the digital footprints of attackers moving laterally through a network."

The TFT touchscreen is a bit dim, doesn’t reproduce colours accurately and doesn’t swivel or tilt, so I ended up using the viewfinder most of the times. I would have preferred a movable OLED screen instead of TFT.


I also loathed the button layout and the sheer size of them. There is very little travel, feedback and they’re just too small.

"Apple Inc plans to cut the price of some of its flagship iPhones for only the second time in the device's 12-year history, pegging its retail value to past prices in local currencies outside the United States instead of the rising U.S. dollar.


The move is an attempt to stem weak sales of the iPhone, particularly in overseas markets such as China, where a 10 percent rise in the U.S. dollar over the past year or so has made Apple's products - which already compete at the top end of the market - much pricier than rivals.


Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook disclosed the plan on Tuesday after the company reported the first-ever dip in iPhone sales during the key holiday shopping period. The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.

"What is in it for Thackeray? It is simply the best opportunity in years to revive his party which had sunk to a nought five years ago, renew his image as a fearless and vociferous state leader, and carve out a niche in the opposition space. Maharashtra’s Assembly election is six months away; his work now – for Congress-NCP – is meant to yield dividends then. “Our real target is the state Assembly and a strong regional profile,"" said a MNS strategist.


In 2009, the then fledgling party had bagged nearly 5% of the vote share contesting only 11 Lok Sabha seats but was the only party to drop its absolute votes in 2014 when all other parties had increased theirs. In the 2009 Assembly election, the MNS won 13 seats with a 12% state-wide vote share – including six seats in Mumbai with a staggering 24% vote share in the city – but dropped to one seat and barely three per cent vote share five years later. That lone MLA too deserted the party as it many of its second-rung leaders. Thackeray and his MNS were all but written off till his Gudi Padwa rally.


The New Year brought a revival in his popularity and underlined his usefulness to contain Modi-Shah. He addresses the disgruntled pro-Modi voters, the fence-sitters, the Shiv Sena voters who love every bit of what he says and wish their leader could have said it all, the youth who are yearning for jobs and work, women and farmers.


The Congress and NCP hope it will turn into votes. It has already in the first two phases, a Congress leader said. Analysts say the Raj Thackeray X-factor may pull in votes which will help to balance out those lost to the third front, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi led by Prakash Ambedkar with help from Asaduddin Owaisi.


It is still early days in this business-like relationship but a compromised or withered Congress-NCP leaning on Thackeray certainly does not augur well for Maharashtra. The out-sourcing has thrown the BJP-Sena off rails. The BJP attempted to take him on but without much success. Modi can neither join his fight nor ignore it. Fadnavis attempted to fill the gap but Thackeray demolished his arguments in following rallies; education minister Vinod Tawde asked the Election Commission to check Thackeray’s expenditure on rallies but that came a cropper because Thackeray does not have candidates or their photos on the dais. The Shiv Sena is confused because Raj, its leaders’ bete-noire, speaks everything that Uddhav wants to about Modi-Shah, but cannot.


“I speak because I want to expose Modi’s lies, I speak in public interest,"" he says. That’s half the story; the other half lies in the realignments that have happened – and will happen – in Maharashtra’s political landscape. Should the Sena sink in this election, Raj Thackeray is prepared to move into that space. Should the Congress-NCP offer him an alliance, he is set to embrace it. If nothing, Raj Thackeray has demonstrated that he’s still in the game."
"As NDA seeks re-election, agriculture will form an important part of the poll narrative with BJP banking on PM-Kisan scheme and its MSP promise


How rural India votes will largely determine the fate of political parties in the general elections, polling for which begins on 11 April.


The focus on rural India in the elections boils down to simple arithmetics—only 57 of the 542 parliamentary constituencies in India are urban, while as many as 342 seats are rural (another 144 are semi-urban), according to numbers based on Census 2011 classification. A constituency is marked ‘urban’ if more than 75% of the constituents live in urban areas.


The importance of this fact isn’t lost on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that won in 178 of the 342 rural seats in 2014, up from 66 in the 2009 elections. The BJP’s caution also stems from the fiasco of 2004, when its ‘India Shining’ campaign backfired, spelling losses.


The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which came to power in May 2014 with a historic mandate, is seeking re-election while the Congress-led opposition parties are bidding to form alliances in key states. Given the stakes, agriculture will form an important part of the narrative of the general elections, to be held in seven phases with polling ending on 19 May.


Over the past few years, the issues plaguing rural India have remained constant. Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed power in May 2014, large swathes of India came under the grip of a drought which lasted for two years until the June of 2016. The crippling drought gave way to three successive years of normal monsoon (2016-2018), leading to record harvests of grains and horticulture crops but this resulted in a sharp plunge in crop prices.


The Modi government may have set an ambitious target to double farmers’ incomes by 2022 (with 2015-16 as the base year) but in reality farm revenues have collapsed due to a consistent fall in crop prices. In January, the wholesale food prices rose by just 2.3% (year-on-year) after being in negative territory for each month between August and December 2018."

But what if you’re more of a person who enjoys music and has an electric guitar lying around in the house? You are in luck because we got you covered on how you can have a productive yet exciting festive season.


The first thing you need to do before you make any serious decision to purchase things online (and offline) is to take a good look at what you actually need in your current gig.


Is it an electric or acoustic? Are the strings alright? Does it have the correct action? Do you need an amplifier? Is there a static noise when you connect your guitar to an amplifier? Do you need new pickups?


Once you find the answer to these questions you’ll understand if it’s time for guitar maintenance or replacement. A lot of times it’s not that necessary to buy an entire guitar just because it doesn’t sound right.


Guitar maintenance is fairly simple and should be done every couple months, depending on your usage. With the help of online guides and video tutorials, you can easily figure out how to change strings by yourself, clean your guitar and even change the action (how straight your guitar neck is)."

There is a lot of talk about Modi and his speeches where he does not talk about things he did not do. About 70% of the assurances made in 2014 remain unfulfilled.

The government may use regulation to control and access data and force firms to share user data with it. The draft Bill exempts the state from seeking users’ consent before accessing their personal data, if it is needed for the function of the state and parliament. Experts say it would be best to have a separate law for data localization.


Industry bodies such as the Internet and Mobile Association of India that represent domestic and global firms have been critical of the draft Bill. They argue that the new regulation on collection and storage of user data will increase the cost burden on tech firms, particularly start-ups. A Delhi-based public policy think tank, The Dialogue, forecasted a loss of nearly 1 percentage point in GDP and added that data localization norms could cost an average Indian worker up to 11% of his/her monthly salary."

"When the candidates arrived, all the questions they fielded related to piped water connections, underground sewage lines, stormwater drains, traffic congestion, and solid waste management. There was very little that related to a member of Parliament’s (MP’s) larger sphere of influence. The sitting MP and the son of a former AIADMK state minister, Jayavardhan Jayakumar who is contesting again, talked about the desalination plants that he had sanctioned and waste treatment plants that have been planned.


Whether the candidate is a newbie or a veteran, the voter blue or white collar, across Chennai, it is local issues and basic infrastructure that dominate campaigns and conversations. Peak summer or ‘kathiri veyil’ is yet to set in but water scarcity is the first, and often the only, topic people talk about. Debates about national security, jobs, the need for a “strong leader"" and fundamental rights that take centre stage in other parts of the country are largely missing.


Pushed to talk about larger policy issues that an MP could exercise influence over in the Lok Sabha, voters pick the imposition of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), and goods and services tax (GST), and centre-state relations. The sheer geographical distance from Delhi gives Tamil Nadu a slightly different perspective on electoral issues. “It’s been eight to 10 years since OMR became functional, but we still don’t have water or sewage lines or street lights. The roads are terrible and that’s because we don’t vote,"" said Harsha Koda, one of the conveners of the four-year-old FOMRRA. “We want to show the politicians that the middle class in OMR can be a vote bank too. If we all turn out, our two lakh-plus votes could be the deciding factor.""


About 25km away, in the heart of Chennai Central constituency, there is not much difference in terms of expectations. “There’s no water in the common taps at which we fill our pots,"" said Venilla, who works as a maid and lives in one of the bylanes off Greames Road on the banks of Chennai’s perennially sluggish and sewage-filled Cooum river. “The candidates have been coming, and we ask them: What have you done to clean our streets?"" A few streets away, Kaladevi S., also complained about the shortage of water.


Mackey’s Garden, where the two women live, and the larger neighbourhood of Thousand Lights and Nungambakkam in which it is situated, is a DMK stronghold. Former Union minister Dayanidhi Maran is looking to win the Chennai Central seat after he was dislodged by the AIADMK in the 2014 polls, when the Jayalalithaa-led party swept 37 of 39 Lok Sabha seats. Maran, who was a minister in the former United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, has represented the seat twice, and his father and former Union minister Murasoli Maran since 1996. This time, he is facing a political greenhorn—entrepreneur, lawyer and Page 3 regular, Sam Paul—who as a Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) member represents the AIADMK-BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) alliance in Tamil Nadu.


“I started my campaign talking about accountability and bringing investment to the state, but when I met people, I realized their most basic needs have not been addressed,"" said Paul, who has built a chain of restaurants and beauty salons. “We have to address water, sanitation, education, and health before we go to larger issues,"" he said. Paul talks of pushing through drinking water and river linking projects if he is elected. “So, you see, these basic issues are also national issues,"" he reasoned.


The opposition DMK, which has the edge going by opinion polls, believes that the pointed demand for civic services is a direct consequence of the AIADMK not holding local body elections for three years. “The city and the state have been neglected by the chaotic AIADMK government, so obviously all (the) voters are asking about traffic, sewage, and water. As a candidate, I can’t dismiss these as local issues since an MP must work on a broad canvas,"" DMK candidate for Chennai South Sumathy ‘Thamizhachi’ Thangapandian, who is fighting her first Lok Sabha election, told voters.


The focus on the hyperlocal is indicative of governance failure, said Swarna Rajagopalan, a political analyst and founder-trustee of Prajnya, an NGO. “An MP should not be concerned about municipal issues, but survival is at stake. Voters are worried about water running out before (the) summer peaks,"" she said."

"Founded by Gadhadar Reddy, Benguluru-based NoPo Nanotechnologies is driven by a vision to enable every human being to access space, but this required the basic building blocks or material that could be easily accessible.


A detailed analysis of existing materials revealed that the single-walled carbon nanotube was the perfect material for this as it is capable of withstanding high and low temperatures, high pressure and radiation while being extremely strong and light.


Reddy, also chief executive officer of Nopo, found that the initial work on carbon nanotubes was done by Nobel laureate Richard Smalley and contacted his student Robert Kelley Bradley to join him in his venture. Reddy discovered that while this was the perfect material for building spacecraft of the present and future, it was difficult to manufacture it consistently on a large scale.


“We made it our mission to develop a technology to manufacture it consistently in copious quantities, and this led to the development of the NoPo HiPCO (high pressure carbon monoxide) technology. It took 6.5 years to fine tune the technology and reach this point where we are ready to scale,’’ adds Reddy.


NoPo has focused efforts on continuously increasing nanotube production while realizing various applications with partners. This allows the startup to build a large ecosystem of products around them."

At the moment, dual-screen phones feel a little vain, compared to foldable screens, which will let users expand the screen size. Two screens can come in handy in different scenarios, like capturing selfies using the rear camera, multitasking or using the back panel as a controller while gaming.

Wireless charging has a lot to with electromagnetic induction—the production of an electromotive force across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field. While this is the text book definition, let’s get real with it.


You might remember this as an experiment in which you moved a magnetic around a copper wire loop with a Galvanometer attached to its ends. The galvanometer needle moved whenever you moved the magnet, indicating the production of current wirelessly inside the copper loop.


The changing magnetic field in this case is the movement of the magnet, the electrical conductor is the copper wire and the electromotive force (or the voltage) is essentially the electrical intensity."

"Jharkhand is part of the economically weaker eastern part of the country and faces a big developmental gap in efforts to catch up with more developed states. It is also a state where polarizing views in favour of cow protection and against religious conversion are strongly felt. The economic headwinds impacting the state are also strong and unpredictable.

"""These are complex issues to get right, and we look forward to working with the government and Parliament to ensure new regulations are effective,"" she said.


Britain will consider imposing financial penalties similar to those under the EU's online data privacy law, which permits fines of up to 4% of a company's annual worldwide revenue, Wright said.


In extreme cases, the government may also seek to fine individual company directors and prevent companies from operating in Britain.


Under the EU legislation that cleared an initial hurdle in Brussels, any internet companies that fail to remove terrorist content within an hour of being notified by authorities would face similar 4% penalties.


EU authorities came up with the idea last year after attacks highlighted the growing trend of online radicalisation.


The bill would apply to companies providing services to EU citizens, whether or not those businesses are based in the EU's 28 member countries. It still needs further approval, including from the full European Parliament.


It faces heavy opposition from digital rights organisations, tech industry groups and some lawmakers, who said the 60-minute deadline is impractical and would lead companies to go too far and remove even lawful material."

In the 147-member state assembly, the BJD has 117 MLAs. The party had won 20 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. A win in 2019 will give BJD chief and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik his fifth term in office.

Number 2 or Numero Uno?In the 1970s, when Amitabh Bachchan – having replaced Rajesh Khanna, to become the undisputed king of box-office – was the ultimate crowd-pleaser, the kitschy multi-starrers and two-hero films also allowed stars like Vinod Khanna, Shashi Kapoor and Shatrughan Sinha to flourish and make a unique name for themselves


 However, no one can deny that Khanna was well-loved by the masses and often put up a tough fight to Bachchan


 While Big B stayed on and had to slug it out in the 1980s before his infamous downfall with ABCL, the restless Khanna packed his bags and quit films (and family, friends, fame and success, not necessarily in that order) to join Osho


 Many aver that if the Salieri to Bachchan’s Mozart hadn’t quit films the history of Hindi cinema and most certainly, Amitabh Bachchan’s own fate, would have turned out differently


PS: As a parting shot, it must be pointed out that, way before anyone did, the legendary Gulzar had captured the poetic gloom, machismo, deep reserves of anger and shy love that Khanna was capable of

For anyone who has an irregular cycle, I would suggest turning off the prediction notification and inputting the data manually every time.


The sleep monitor on the Versa Lite was extremely helpful for me. Because I have always been a disturbed or light sleeper, I could track exactly how much I was sleeping at night, how much of it was deep sleep, how much was light and how much was rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (this means, I was dreaming more around these times and my pulse rate would have been higher as well).

"Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.


AI is a key technology enabler for all megatrends that are set to redefine the automotive industry. Autonomous driving, for example, relies on AI, because it is the only technology that enables reliable, real-time recognition of objects around the vehicle. AI creates numerous opportunities to reduce costs, improve operations, and generate new revenue streams. For shared-mobility services, for example, AI can help optimize pricing by predicting and matching demand and supply. Improvements realized through AI will play an important role for automotive companies in the future.


Blockchain is seen to provide new applications with connected cars, vehicle safety and data security, supply chain transparency and in the world of automotive financing. 3D printing is seen to support better parts prototyping and in several weight reduction initiatives in the automotive industry.


The automotive industry is always evolving and has, in the last few years, been going through constant disruption. At Mercedes-Benz too, a strategy termed C.A.S.E —Connected, Autonomous, Shared and Services and Electric—is being applied as a guiding principle for defining the future.


The cars of the future are designed and intended to be highly connected. With their ‘Always On’ feature, there is a huge amount of data expected to be transferred from the car to the cloud and back. Compared to 4G, 5G is set to significantly increase the sustainable bandwidth of both data uplink as well as downlink.


The amount of pure-play digital startups in the country that are catering to making lives easier are increasing by the day.


While it is shown that many jobs done by humans today AI can potentially do better, there are still thousands of areas where human intervention and deployment would be necessary. It calls for better coordination between AI and humans.

While 2018 has been a good year for demonstrating use cases of 5G, next year is poised to be the year of 5G field trials in India. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) will drive the first wave of 5G, while Massive IoT and digitalization of vertical industries will drive the next wave of 5G. The rollout of 5G will be at the heart of the proliferation of other technologies such as AI, IoT and AR-VR globally and in India. At Huawei we believe the future will be intelligent, AI-driven. The key to staying competitive in such an environment lies in data and analytics including AI, so businesses will have to become an intelligent enterprise in an intelligent world. We are exploring how existing technologies can be upgraded to 5G.


EU’s GDPR does not impact Indian companies if they are not processing data of citizens residing within EU.


When the government rechristens its flagship National Telecom Policy as the National Digital Communications Policy 2018 (NDCP 2018), it’s a clear indication of its continued commitment to the realization of its Digital India vision and enabling its citizens with a Digital way of life.


Indian enterprises are taking appropriate measures to safeguard themselves and their users, which include appointing a chief information security officer, conducting annual cybersecurity audits and improving the overall product security capability by frequent testing.


However, with the widespread adoption of technologies such as AI, they need scientists. While there will be much less demand for jobs that handle repetitive tasks in future, the focus will shift to more meaningful tasks. Technologically-advanced economies are already creating full-fledged jobs that require AI skill sets. That said, talent availability remains a concern. Huawei will be investing more than $140 million (including Huawei Cloud AI resources and AI suites) in AI talent education.


Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.


The trends that are shaping IT are a combination of all of these technologies. To experience the full value of these modern tools, integration is the only way forward. The common factor between all these technologies is data; IoT and blockchain provide a network between devices that pull out vast scores of data. Rich analytics and insights are inferred and then intelligently used to fuel solutions such as AI, robotics, and AR-VR. While each of these solutions have vast implications, it may be said that IoT will have the largest impact due to its ability to integrate.


The GDPR regulations pushed Indian businesses to upgrade their privacy policies for global customers and not only their clients in the EU.


5G is expected to drive emerging technologies such as IoT, AR and VR. It is going to have a big impact on segments beyond mobile broadband such as smart cities, robotics, self-driving cars, healthcare, agriculture, and education. Cisco is working with BSNL to demonstrate use cases of 5G to address challenges in areas like education, healthcare and agriculture."

"This looks like a bit of a change in strategy, keeping in mind that Singtel had increased its stake in Bharti Airtel from around 33% to 39.5% between August 2016 and February 2018. This was the period when the onslaught from Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd was at its peak, and Singtel’s unflinching support was a heartening factor for Bharti Airtel investors.


But Singtel’s decision to give up the chance to maintain its stake hasn’t particularly perturbed analysts. “The primary issue here is that Airtel raises the ₹25,000 crore it aims to from the rights issue. A change in the underlying shareholding pattern is a matter of secondary importance,"" said an analyst with an institutional brokerage firm.


Singtel is majority owned by Temasek Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd, another Singapore sovereign wealth fund, and investors may not be particularly bothered which of the Singaporean entities the money comes from, as long as the funding tap stays strong. To be sure, some analysts are seeing it as a vote of confidence from another large investor.


Besides, as far as Singtel goes, it must be noted that it had recently also made an investment in Bharti Airtel’s African business, which is busy preparing for an initial public offering. And it will remain Bharti Airtel’s largest shareholder."
"The good news is that exports showed a healthy growth of 11% in March, which took the growth for the full year to 9%. Exporting farm products was easier, though Indian manufacturers had a tough time selling their finished wares. For them, the situation could get worse before it gets better.


The slowdown in global economic growth is not helping in terms of demand as leading advanced economies are grappling with their own growth issues.


The odds are stacked against exports growth in the coming months, as projections of global economic growth has been cut by multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In this no-holds-barred slugfest for political one-upmanship, the most dangerous strand has been dragging the armed forces into the election narrative


In an ideal world, this should have been the election in which Kanhaiya Kumar, and the millions of young Indians like him, found their true expression. The 32-year-old former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union, who is contesting from the Begusarai parliamentary seat in Bihar as a candidate of the Communist Party of India (CPI), wrote in a piece for online magazine Scroll that he stood for “a politics that dreams of an India that rises beyond what divides us, and celebrates what unites us. A politics that dreams of a society that truly values individual rights, inclusive development and progressive thinking"".


In a country where the median age is 28, and where 15 million young people aged 18 or 19 are likely to vote for the first time, those words may well sum up the zeitgeist of a New India.


In reality, though, their voice has barely risen above the din, completely drowned by the cacophony of grizzly politicians, who are cynically exploiting every available fault-line between communities, castes and ethnic groupings with the sole objective of garnering more votes. In this milieu, rabid acrimony has marked the buildup to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections."

""The proposed changes are going overboard and are not consistent with strong privacy protections that people around the world are seeking,"" said Woog, who served as the Spokesperson for the Barack Obama administration in the US.


""Given the end-to-end encryption we have in place, the regulations will require us to re-artchitect our product,"" he said, adding that in such a scenario, the messaging service would cease to exist in its current form."

About 44% are working class people, excluding those involved in agriculture.


Agricultural distress, lack of jobs and reservations are the key issues for voters. Farmers of Maharashtra were always considered the most prosperous in the country. Despite this, the state has seen the highest number of street protests by farmers in the last three years due to non-remunerative farm prices. The state is among the biggest generators of employment in the country. However, the Marathas have demanded a quota for their community in education and jobs. The state government bowed to this demand and passed a bill proposing 16% quota for them in these two fields. This decision has been challenged in court."

"As computing and communications improve dramatically and more and more people across the nation participate in the digital economy, we need to make choices, which will create profound impact on our economy and society, according to the report.


The idea of ‘digital transformation’ is vast enough to re-shape the investment, trade, jobs and skills of any nation. Digital transformation is not a one-time event; instead, it refers to phase-driven digital progress, maturity and diffusion of innovations at various levels of society.


According to the report, the first phase of digitalisation was associated with ‘mature’ technologies, such as management information systems (MIS), internet and its corresponding platforms and telecommunications technologies (voice, broadband).


The second phase, according to the report, entails the adoption of a range of advanced technologies, such as Big Data/analytics, Internet of Things, robotics, and artificial intelligence, aimed at automating work processes and improving overall human productivity and efficiency.


It is crucial to understand the impact of all these technologies and devise policies that will allow us to fully leverage the economic benefits and minimise social anomalies."

While expectations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will win a second term in the ongoing elections and bets that company earnings will recover added legs to the rally, headwinds are stacking up fast. The surge in prices of crude oil -- India’s top import -- is combining with a slowdown in investment and consumption, all of which threaten to put the brakes on growth in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.

Part of the reason it hasn't been able to monetize this trend is that it often has the same problem as the consumer: it doesn't necessarily know if something is sponsored. By forcing influencers to signal such posts, for example with a label Advertisement Feature, the CMA is helping the Menlo Park, California-based firm better understand the content. The CMA is following the lead of the Federal Trade Commission, which made a similar move in 2017. The other reason is that Facebook may not want to send celebs fleeing to another social network."

In February, the company announced that the watch would track skiing and snowboarding runs , including data on speed and vertical descent.


The latest Apple Watch version unveiled Wednesday is pushing the health envelope even further — in particular by taking electrocardiograms, or EKGs, on the device, a feature given clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Apple said. The watch will also watch for irregular heartbeats and can detect when the wearer has fallen, the company said.

"This rural-urban comparison, however, is fraught with problems, including price-index issues and the difficulty of accounting for differences in living environment, social infrastructure, and so on.


“Multi-dimensional poverty"" estimates, based on a direct assessment of living conditions, point to a much sharper rural-urban contrast. For instance, the estimated multi-dimensional poverty headcount was as high as 36.5% in rural India in 2015-16, compared with just 9% in urban India. These figures imply that 90% of poor people in India live in rural areas.


NINTH, NYAY should begin as a scheme and then move towards a legal framework, if it works reasonably well. Without a legal framework, the scheme could prove short-lived. The law should provide for indexation of NYAY pension amounts on the price level, or even better, for some increase in the real value of NYAY pensions over time.


FINALLY, the technology of cash transfers needs careful thought. Despite tall claims of financial inclusion, India still lacks a reliable and user-friendly infrastructure for cash transfers in rural areas. Several attempts to replace PDS food rations with cash transfers in recent years have had sobering results, partly due to defective payment systems. The Aadhaar Payment Bridge System is a particularly problematic technology.


These ten suggestions do not add up to a clear plan for NYAY. They would, however, make it possible to redeem about half of NYAY’s promise within a couple of years, in a fairly safe and appealing manner. What I have in mind is that the initial target groups I have proposed are likely to add up to something like 10-12% of the population—about half of NYAY’s proposed coverage of 20%.


Covering them as a “first step"" would have the great advantage of avoiding divisiveness, and indeed, creating a broad constituency for NYAY: a large majority of households would have a stake in it, as potential recipients of old-age pensions and maternity benefits. Further, the operational challenge would be much reduced, since it is largely a matter of expanding schemes that are already in place.


The other half of NYAY I shall leave, for now, to the imagination of the reader and future commentators. This is not to say that the first step should be taken without being clear about the next one. NYAY will need an end-to-end roadmap before it is launched. That, however, is likely to require a participatory consultation process—not restricted to economists—over a period of time. Forming an expert committee to operationalize the 6x20 formula will not do.

"Rate cut rabbit was also dressed up with a veiled promise of more cuts through a reduction in inflation forecasts


MUMBAI: As surprises went, the monetary policy packed a punch this time. Not only was a rate cut rabbit pulled out of the hat, but it was also dressed up with the veiled promise of more cuts through a reduction in inflation forecasts.


What was even more surprising was that the hands holding the hat included long-standing hawk Michael Patra, in-charge of monetary policy at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).


Gaurav Kapur, chief economist at IndusInd Bank Ltd, says, “While the change in the monetary policy committee’s (MPC’s) stance was along expected lines, the timing of the cut has come as a slight surprise. Note also that in the run-up to this meeting, the overnight index swaps market was pricing in only one rate cut within the next one year, keeping in mind the expansionary nature of the interim budget and high core inflation.""


RBI’s rate-setting MPC voted 4:2 for a cut, with governor Shaktikanta Das decidedly in favour of one. If we look only at headline inflation, a rate cut was a no-brainer. It came in at merely 2.2% in December, something that a fastidious RBI should be alarmed about, since the risk of inflation breaching the lower 2% barrier was real."

In fact, the Cupertino-based company launched other fan favourite devices (which were desperately in need of a revamp) at a separate event to avoid dousing the flames of the new iPhones (and Apple Watch).


We can expect Samsung to do the same; given the new foldable smartphone passes all the necessary quality tests and is fit for production—it will be a massive embarrassment for Samsung if it lets out a half-baked product at such a crucial time."

One of the key selling points of the handset is the 4,000mAh battery, which seems very good on paper. In reality, it will last a little less than a day. There’s also no fast charging, so it can take you anywhere between 4-5 hours to fully charge the phone.

"MUMBAI: The markets regulator on Tuesday cracked the whip on National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE), directing it to deposit nearly ₹1,000 crore in an investor fund and barring it from accessing capital markets for six months, besides clawing back a chunk of salaries from its two former CEOs, for lapses in its algorithmic trading systems and co-location services.


In a set of five orders issued on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) asked NSE to “disgorge"" its profits from co-location worth ₹624.89 crore at 12% interest to the Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF). The amount with interest would add up to about ₹1,000 crore. The Sebi order also pushes back NSE’s much-delayed ₹10,000 crore initial share sale well beyond six months.


The Sebi order said NSE had failed to ensure equal and fair access to all members when they were using its algorithmic trading platform and co-location services. Between 2011 and 2014, under co-location services, some brokers trading from the same premises where NSE’s algorithmic trading servers were located were able to get faster access to the trading systems, thereby gaining an unfair advantage over others.


Sebi also punished Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramakrishna, NSE’s two former CEOs and founding members. Narain, who was heading the exchange between 2010 and 2013, was asked to deposit 25% of his salary for the three fiscals in IPEF, while Ramakrishna, who was the CEO of the exchange starting fiscal 2014, must deposit 25% of her salary for that fiscal. She stepped down as CEO in December 2016.


The strictures against the two, which called the episode “bad governance"" on the part of NSE, include a bar on associating with any listed company or a market infrastructure institution (MII) or any other market intermediary for five years."

"Chhabra says people want to meet new people but they don’t only want to meet and endlessly chat. That’s why Lemonade has a swipe feature just like Tinder. You can swipe right or left on people, connect with them, and then choose offline activities. MyScoot’s Yadav says he too has plans to add a feature that connects people to each other.


At the moment, both platforms have two kinds of users—hosts and guests. The hosts organise parties, events and experiences, while the guests attend them. Some users are engaged in both activities. Once a host creates an “experience"", like a movie night, poker night or something else, guests pay (fees that are usually kept under ₹1,000) to come to that experience. Hosts are allowed to select who gets to attend the event, and the companies also have checks in place to vet the users on the platform. This will be very important in the long run, once they gain more traction.


At the moment, MyScoot and Lemonade Social both count users in the thousands, but the goal of course is to spread to the millions. In fact, Lemonade is already expanding to Barcelona, and wants to use the platform to allow creative professionals from India to host experiences in Barcelona.

"Addressing an election campaign rally at Ausa in Marathwada’s Latur, which was also attended by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, Modi said the Congress manifesto had life till May 23 only — the counting day — while the BJP Sankalp Patra was for the next five years. Modi made an impassioned appeal to first-time voters to dedicate their first vote to the “soldier, the martyrs of Pulwama, the society, the farmer, the nation, and nationalism"". He said the NDA, unlike the Congress-led “Mahamilavat gathbandhan"", was committed to building a strong and new India and blamed the Congress for speaking the language of Pakistan.


This was the first time Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray shared stage with Modi after the saffron parties renewed their alliance in February. Both Modi and Thackeray displayed great bonhomie, entering the stage holding hands. In his speech, Uddhav addressed Modi as “Narendra bhai"" and Modi reciprocated by describing the Shiv Sena chief as his “younger brother"". Modi apparently tapped the common emotion among the BJP-Shiv Sena cadres for Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray when he referred to the “Congress party’s decision to disenfranchise Balasaheb Thackeray"". The Election Commission had in 1999 debarred Thackeray from voting and contesting election for six years with effect from 1995 for a controversial speech he gave during a by-poll campaign in 1987. Modi said Congress had no moral right to talk about human right violations.


Launching a broadside on the Congress manifesto, Modi said the document spoke the language of Pakistan in its proposal of scrapping the Armed Forces Special Protection Act (AFSPA), the sedition law, and was lenient on those who abused the nation."

Amazon.com Inc. employs thousands of people around the world to help improve the Alexa digital assistant powering its line of Echo speakers. The team listens to voice recordings captured in Echo owners’ homes and offices. The recordings are transcribed, annotated and then fed back into the software as part of an effort to eliminate gaps in Alexa’s understanding of human speech and help it better respond to commands. 


The Alexa voice review process, described by seven people who have worked on the program, highlights the often-overlooked human role in training software algorithms. In marketing materials Amazon says Alexa “lives in the cloud and is always getting smarter."" But like many software tools built to learn from experience, humans are doing some of the teaching.


The team comprises a mix of contractors and full-time Amazon employees who work in outposts from Boston to Costa Rica, India and Romania, according to the people, who signed nondisclosure agreements barring them from speaking publicly about the program. They work nine hours a day, with each reviewer parsing as many as 1,000 audio clips per shift, according to two workers based at Amazon’s Bucharest office, which takes up the top three floors of the Globalworth building in the Romanian capital’s up-and-coming Pipera district. The modern facility stands out amid the crumbling infrastructure and bears no exterior sign advertising Amazon’s presence.


The work is mostly mundane. One worker in Boston said he mined accumulated voice data for specific utterances such as “Taylor Swift"" and annotated them to indicate the searcher meant the musical artist. Occasionally the listeners pick up things Echo owners likely would rather stay private: a woman singing badly off key in the shower, say, or a child screaming for help. The teams use internal chat rooms to share files when they need help parsing a muddled word—or come across an amusing recording."

"In August, after Rishi Kapoor announced his family’s decision to sell RK Studios in Chembur, established by his late father Raj Kapoor in 1948, thousands of film-goers grieved for the loss


 Today, as the iconic studio finally changes hand with Godrej Properties Ltd buying it for an undisclosed amount, it’s more than just a slice gone


 For Raj Kapoor, who passed away in 1988, the two acres of land in Mumbai’s eastern suburbs on which RK Studios was built and the showman’s personal cottage nearby was very much a kingdom from where he “literally ruled the industry and Indian cinema,” as RK heroine Padmini Kolhapure told The Hindustan Times


 Elsewhere, many have recounted the studio in reverential terms, as a “temple,” underscoring the spiritual attachment that Kapoor felt towards the studio he so lovingly built


As any Bollywood fan knows, the legendary filmmaker founded RK Films in 1948 and Aag became the first movie to be made under that banner


 Also starring Nargis, Prem Nath and Kamini Kaushal, Kapoor’s directorial debut was a flop but sent him hurtling towards the long and tortured road to auteurship


 The semi-autobiographical Aag starred Kapoor (only 24, RK was as clean-faced as they come, the Clark Gable-esque pencil moustache still some years ahead of him) as the idealistic youth consumed by a singular passion to become a stage artiste


 The film is based on his father Prithviraj Kapoor’s desire and struggle to start his own theatre company despite parental objection and predates some of the themes that defined later Raj Kapoor classics – youthful idealism, love triangle featuring childhood friends, clash of traditions and overbearing parents, erotic lyricism and romanticism, the magnificently-shot song sequences and of course, Nargis


 Subversive, sexy, glamazon, outspoken and a Freudian mix of beauty and purity, the RK heroine held her own


 It all started with Nargis, but over the years, the armament included Simi Garewal, Padmini Kolhapure, Mandakini, Dimple Kapadia, Zeenat Aman and Aishwarya Rai


 The master director often caused a stir by showing the young dames as sexy sirens and objects of his oedipal and voyeuristic fetishes and wet dreams


 His next Barsaat, made in 1949, poured in a fortune for the fledgeling star – enough to set up RK Studios"

Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and his two nephews Dharmendra Yadav and Akshay Yadav are seeking re-election from Mainpuri, Badaun and Firozabad seats respectively. Mulayam has said this will he his last contest.


Voting will be held in seven Lok Sabha seats in Chhattisgarh, of which the BJP had won six in 2014. The Congress, buoyed by its victory in the Assembly elections last year, is hoping to improve its tally in the state.

"After the FTC filed its complaint in January 2017, Apple quickly followed with a similar suit, accusing Qualcomm of holding the industry ransom with patents that underpin how modern phone systems work. That move spawned a global web of litigation involving the two companies, with Qualcomm saying in October that Apple owed it $7 billion in unpaid licensing fees.


Qualcomm argues the US simply has its facts wrong and has failed to demonstrate any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by the chipmaker against its rivals.


Nonetheless, Qualcomm has taken a couple of pre-trial hits from the judge. While a key part of the government’s case is its allegation that the company tried to force Apple to use its chips exclusively, Koh ruled that Qualcomm can’t point to Apple’s growing dependence on Intel Corp. to prove otherwise.


Currently Qualcomm doesn’t give licenses to its chipmaker rivals such as Intel and MediaTek Inc. Qualcomm argues they don’t need the licenses because it gets paid by the handset makers and it’s never sued them for using its technology.


The FTC contends that Qualcomm’s refusal to license patents to competitors including Intel and Samsung Electronics Co. was part of a scheme to maintain its monopoly.


Koh concluded in November that Qualcomm is required to license patents under commitments the company made to industry groups to provide them on fair and reasonable terms."

"1980’s Qurbani is the biggest success of Feroz Khan’s career and it is a film he is probably best known for


 Once dubbed ‘Eastwood of the East’ for his cowboy swagger in the 1970s curry Westerns such as Khote Sikkay and Kaala Sona, Khan was 41 at the time of Qurbani’s release — an age when most Bollywood male stars are still in their prime


 Like Clint Eastwood, he had come in from nowhere, from bit roles in B movies and a largely forgettable provenance


 Qurbani is also a movie that best embodies the Feroz Khan cult and was influential in creating the late actor-director’s popularity as a “yaaro ka yaar,” both on and off screen


 Bollywood of a certain vintage was fond of depicting the Pathans as flamboyantly loyal and benevolent friends


 A case in point is Pran’s short but significant turn as inspector Vijay’s (Amitabh Bachchan) devoted friend in Zanjeer in 1973

"The BJP in Karnataka is relying heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retain its existing seats, let alone win new ones in a state which has a tendency to vote for different parties at the state and national elections.


Yeddyurappa had earlier said that if the party managed to win 22 seats in the state, it would be able to form the government in Karnataka as well. In a recent interview to Mint, Yeddyurappa had said that the coalition itself was not confident to carry on after the elections, referring to the hard stand taken by the JD(S) and the Congress in seat sharing discussions that has compounded its problems.


But the Congress is trying hard to make this coalition work as it would help the party stitch multiple alliances with other parties across the country to take on PM Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Despite being the larger partner, the Congress has given up the top post and 11 other ministries in the cabinet to its smaller partner, just to keep the BJP, that emerged as the single largest party in the May assembly elections, out of power in the state.


But it was hoping that its sacrifices in the state would help it win a higher number of seats in the Lok Sabha elections to help it overcome the devastating defeat in 2014 when it was reduced to double digits."
"This coincided with Congress-NCP leaders doubling down after the rout in 2014, their voices feeble, their agendas nowhere as scathing as needed, and their coordination appalling. Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, leader of opposition in the assembly, is on the verge of hopping across to the BJP; his son Sujay is a BJP candidate this election. Narayan Rane, a pugnacious street-fighter, distanced himself from the Congress and set up his own outfit. The NCP’s Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, former minister, was on stage last week with Modi; his exit remains a formality. When the 2019 election was announced, the Congress-NCP was hard put to draw up a list of campaigners. After Rahul Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, the list had virtually no state-level leader.


Enter Raj Thackeray with his mass appeal, oratory, and the willingness to join the big fight. This was not the Thackeray of 2009 or 2014 with glib lines, mockery and mime, cheap jokes and one-liners. He had brought substantive issue-based criticism, gravitas and reflection to his natural flair for drama and his uncle’s Bal Thackeray-style oratory. He chose subjects with care, sent his party workers to get ground-level information as journalists do, had corporate style presentations prepared.


Thackeray has, wittingly or otherwise, become the face of opposition to Modi-Shah in Maharashtra. He is hitting the BJP where it hurts most, fracturing Modi’s goodwill and good intentions, says political scientist Suhas Palshikar. “There were a number of issues on which to take on Modi and Fadnavis. The Congress-NCP didn’t know how to shape them and reach people, or didn’t bother,"" Palshikar added, “Thackeray has given them the strong push they needed in this election.""


The Congress-NCP will be the obvious but unstated beneficiaries of Thackeray’s aggressive and popular campaigning. In fact, a cartoon in a leading Marathi daily showed Thackeray carrying the burden of the electioneering on his shoulders with pit stops across the state, with Congress state president Ashok Chavan and Sharad Pawar ambling two steps behind, discussing Thackeray’s “fees"".


The MNS and Congress-NCP differ ideologically. Thackeray’s political articulation, fluid, non-inclusive and parochial since he broke away from his uncle’s Shiv Sena, is still that. He speaks of Marathi youth not getting jobs, his men bashed up a Modi bhakt who called Thackeray names, he refers to Marathi sub-nationalism. But the Congress-NCP has sacrificed ideological reservations at the altar of tactical electoral gains.


NCP chief Pawar even attempted to bring Thackeray formally into the alliance but the Congress did not yield given Thackeray’s earlier anti-north Indians and parochial agenda. An alliance might have hurt the Congress but it did not mind the out-sourcing arrangement with Thackeray. Both now hope that the MNS votes will transfer to Congress or NCP candidates this election."

"There are two reasons why Kansai Nerolac would be among the casualties of a slowdown in the automobile sector. One, it is the market leader in the industrial paints segment, which forms 45% of its revenue, with the auto industry having the highest share. Two, Maruti Suzuki is the company’s biggest client. So, this double whammy of sorts would accentuate pressure on its already struggling industrial paints business.


To put things into perspective, Kansai Nerolac’s paint volumes grew in the high double-digits in the December quarter. The growth was largely led by the decorative paints segment. The industrial segment, including automotive, is weak, making it difficult to take price hikes, the company’s management told analysts.


Back then itself, analysts were worried about the delay in price hikes for industrial clients. As a result of the ongoing slowdown, operating margin would remain under check."

The farmer theme though is not as strong…during his regime, a lot may have been done, but on-ground, the feedback is not all positive.""


Goyal said nationalism could be a big poll theme this year and Uri, the movie, had set the tone. “The happenings at Pulwama and the retaliation at Balakot will surely be a big part of the Modi narrative in the elections. Nationalism is a big stroke. National pride is an even bigger stimulus.""


Unfortunately, nationalism in the garb of patriotism has become mainstream over the past five years, said advertising expert Sanjay Sarma, founder of SSarma Consults, a boutique branding and communications advisory. “That’s been one of the biggest achievements of this government.

While the BJP has always been about ‘nation first’, this time I see them pushing the envelope to propagate the 'us versus them' or 'national versus anti-national' theory in the voter’s mind.""


That is not all. The Modi government will most likely play up some of its achievements and highlight various schemes which have been announced over the past five years, and buy more time from voters to ensure their effective implementation. “That could be the primary plank to ask people to vote them in again. Secondly, in the absence of any strong opposition within or outside, Mr. Modi’s personality and leadership may be played up again. There is still a large population of Modi fans in this country, though not as high as 2014,"" Sarma said."

"""This is probably as good as it is likely to get for the dollar,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, adding: ""the Fed has become more dovish than we had anticipated more quickly and has increased the risks that the dollar may weaken more notably.""


""But the other side of the coin is the story outside of the U.S. - the fundamentals are still weak and it is difficult to find currencies to stop the dollar at this point in time.""


Speculators increased their bets in favour of the greenback to the highest since December 2015 in the last week of 2018 - the most recent data - according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggesting a long-dollar position is a crowded trade.


Euro zone growth has also slowed sharply and is likely to restrain the European Central Bank - which only just stopped buying billions of euros worth of bonds each month - from lifting interest rates off the floor any time soon.


""Maybe we will see a recovery in euro zone growth this year, but economic data is just not supportive of that. Right now, it is difficult to be bullish on the euro,"" said Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank.


The euro was at best forecast to claw back its around 5 percent losses against the dollar since the start of last year. The single currency was forecast to trade around $1.20 in a year from about $1.14 on Wednesday."
"New Delhi: While there were several leaps in the field of AI and machine learning in 2018, enterprise security was a point of major concern. Seqrite, the enterprise arm of Quick Heal Technologies, underlined the growing risk that the escalating evolution of the threat landscape poses to Indian organisations with its Quarterly Threat Report.


The most worrying statistic as revealed by the report was the sheer volume of threats that organisations across sectors faced. Seqrite detected more than 2.6 crore threats targeting Indian enterprises during the three-month period – translating to a per day detection rate of over 2.8 lakhs threats.


According to the report, ransomware, exploits, PUA, adware, infectors and worms remained popular attack vectors for cybercriminals, but what was interesting to note was the growing threat posed by cryptojacking. Seqrite detected over 24,000 Cryptojacking hits on a daily basis during Q3 2018, underlining the growing popularity of this relatively new threat."

"While these look like typical, high-end 2019 flagship specifications, the device is far from fast. Every swipe has a noticeable delay, every app stutters—the experience extremely unpolished. This can be attributed to a heavy and unrefined UI and lack of OS optimisation in general.


The FlexPai has two cameras in 16MP+12MP configuration. The cameras are capable of taking images comparable to mid-range smartphones. But I would hold further judgement on that as I haven't really tried it in various lighting scenarios.


The camera interface was a whole different story. Since the camera app can be opened when the device is folded or unfolded, it opens up a whole new bunch of challenges.


The app offers a regular, run-of-the-mill experience when the FlexPai isn't folded. However, if you wish to use the app when it is folded, the device requires you to enable another auto-rotate button, adding to the chaos. Yes, there are two rotation locks simply because of an added dimension when the device is folded. You will have to enable this for other apps as well, including video and photo apps.


The transition from the folded to unfolded forms isn't seamless either. I tried doing this three times and the app crashed twice. The viewfinder also appears to be stretched in the folded mode."
"It went on to add that in single phase election manifesto cannot be released during prohibitory period and in multi-phase polls, it cannot be released in prohibitory period of all the phases.


Technically, it allows political parties to release manifestos in the middle of polling phases too provided it does not take place in the 48 hour period. This would come to aid for particularly regional or state level political parties which may release manifestos just before the phases of polling specific to them."

"Money-losing Uber is one of a swarm of tech-related companies that have gone public this year or are considering it. Alongside Pinterest, Zoom Video Communications Inc. made its trading debut this month. Other high-profile startups looking to go public include Slack Technologies Inc., Postmates Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc.


In its initial IPO filing, Uber revealed an operating loss of $3 billion in 2018, bringing its total operating losses over the past three years to more than $10 billion. The San Francisco-based company is planning to pitch itself to possible investors as a global transportation platform, people familiar with the matter have said, building -- and then supplying -- new demand for everything from scooters and bicycles to freight and food delivery.

"Incessant anti-BJP campaign and personal attacks against PM Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis by Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana and Shiv Sena leaders were aggressively countered by local BJP leaders, especially Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar and sitting MP from North East Mumbai Kirit Somaiyya who has been denied a ticket by the BJP, reportedly at the behest of Shiv Sena. In February 2017, BJP won 8 out of 10 municipal elections in the state and almost matched the Shiv Sena tally in Mumbai. However, Shiv Sena succeeded in keeping its control over Mumbai. Later, BJP won the Palghar Lok Sabha seat bypolls in May 2018 after a bitter fight against the Sena.


When the alliance was renewed in February this year, the Sena played hardball and extracted 23 Lok Sabha seats and half the 288 assembly seats. For now, it seems like both parties have buried the hatchet. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and chief minister Fadnavis are campaigning together. But would that convince their voters?"

The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable commerce in online users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99% of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google's parent Alphabet, it was 85%, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA.


Amazon, too, doesn't just sell products online; it provides ad space, too. The company doesn't say how much but has said that the ""other"" revenue in its financial reports is mainly from ads. Its ""other"" revenue topped $10 billion last year, more than double what it was in 2017.


The tech giants' problematic relationship with advertisers was spotlighted by action regulators took last month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development filed civil charges against Facebook, accusing it of allowing landlords and real estate brokers to exclude certain racial or ethnic groups from seeing ads for houses and apartments. Facebook could face penalties.


The company has separately agreed to overhaul its ad targeting system and end some of the practices noted by HUD to prevent discrimination in housing listings as well as credit and employment ads. That move was part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists.


Besides crafting a bipartisan data-privacy measure in Congress, lawmakers are considering restoring Obama-era rules that formerly barred internet providers — like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast — from discriminating against certain technologies and services.

"Asia’s second-largest software exporter, Infosys Ltd., kicks off the quarterly earnings season in India on Friday


Global analyst projection for next year’s earnings at S&P BSE Sensex Index companies has jumped to a record high


'We expect earnings to grow at 15 percent to 20 percent and that should drive markets higher,' said analysts


For stocks worldwide, it may be time to worry about the upcoming earnings season. But there’s one place where profit estimates are surging: India.


The fundamentals of corporate India are improving, and the average analyst projection for next year’s earnings at S&P BSE Sensex Index companies has jumped to a record high -- not just in rupee terms, but also in US dollars. That’s a stark contrast with members of the MSCI All-Country World Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which have seen steady declines in estimates.


“We expect the earnings recovery momentum to continue this quarter as well with aggregate earnings growth expected in mid-double digits,"" said Jyoti Vaswani, the Mumbai-based chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance Co. overseeing ₹40 billion ($570 million) in assets. She expects corporate banks to report a significant recovery in earnings, while retail banks are expected to continue with their steady performance.


The beginning of the earnings recovery may be apparent in results for the final quarter of the last financial year, ended March 31, particularly when it comes to banks. With financials accounting for more than a third of the Sensex, good results for the sector could help boost the nation’s stock market. A pickup in credit demand and a recovery in loans is helping the firms now, after a mountain of bad debt — especially at state-run banks — dented profitability last year and took the market down 14 percent from a peak."
"The Note 7 Pro belongs to the new generation of big-screen phones with thin bezel designs. It has a 6.3-inch screen, which is pretty much the standard screen size in all big screen Android phones these days. With a resolution of 2,340x1,080p, the LCD screen is technically at par with any other phone in this price point.


The screen manages to reproduce the right amount of colour in videos and games and is neither oversaturated nor washed out. The display setting has an option to enhance the contrast for users who like more vivid colours.


To protect the screen against scratches and accidental drops from short height, Xiaomi has used Gorilla Glass 5 on the front, which is still a rarity in this price point.


One of the strong points of Xiaomi smartphones is it's user interface. The latest version, MIUI 10.2, is one of the best designed Android UIs with lots of unique features. The Redmi Note 7 Pro runs MIUI 10.2 on top of Android 9.


MIUI has some nifty features like the optional gesture controls. Users can go back to a previous screen by swiping from the left or right edge of screen. Similarly, swiping up from the lower edge of the screen takes the user back to the home screen, while swiping up and holding opens background apps. It's quite intuitive and easy to get a hang of, and makes the traditionalnavigation keys seem like a wastage of screen space."

The venue wore a festive look with workers of the alliance partners carrying party flags in myriad hues.


The BSP chief also said the BJP will advertise its ""hawa-hawai (lofty)"" schemes till the poll results are announced, wasting thousands of crores of money which could be used for the welfare of the poor.


""If the PM (Narendra Modi) was serious about welfare of the poor, they would not have been inaugurating schemes after polls were announced. They would have performed during their five years. In the last budget...whatever announcements were made by the government were nothing but empty poll promises,"" she said.


""Now that the BJP is panicking, you should know they are on their way out...and grand alliance will come to power,"" she said.


She was equally critical of the Congress' Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY), under which the party promise a minimum guaranteed income to the poor.


""The Congress too has been making tall claims, haven't they been given enough chances for decades? The Nyay scheme is not a stable solution for removing poverty, the BSP believes giving jobs to every hand is,"" she said.

“National parties are getting squeezed out from most states in the south,"" Sumanth Raman, a Chennai-based political analyst said.


The Congress got 38.95% of votes polled in the south in 2009, winning 33 seats. The vote share shrank to 11.62% in 2014 with the party winning just two seats in Andhra Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, the party’s vote share fell from 15.03% to 4.37% in the same period. This is significant as it had a large support base across the region until the surge of regional parties."

Not just one, but a consortium of all these technologies will create a significant impact in 2019. It will not be humanely possible to analyse and make sense out of the humongous amount of data being generated by various devices and sensors. AI, ML and DL will, hence, play a critical role in deriving actionable insights from the data. We foresee AI and ML leading the largest productivity increases we’ve seen in the years.

In 2018, India’s digital growth graph has been fantastic. The government of India’s progressive digital schemes like Digital India, Smart cities, Aadhaar, etc., proved to be a turning point for the entire economy. Dell EMC has been extensively working on these key government initiatives. Majority of large banks (like SBI) use our technology.


According to ‘Realize 2030’ a Dell Technologies report, only 48% business leaders feel they have ineffective cybersecurity measures in place today. However, a whopping 97% feel they will have effective cybersecurity defences in place by the year 2030. However, implementation has a long way to go.


Emerging technologies like AI will transform every business. As the adoption of these technologies increase, this will enable us to digitally conduct our lives and learn in-the-moment. Contrary to common perception, Dell EMC believes that this won’t result in reducing number of jobs but, instead, create newer skill sets which are needed for humans and technology to work alongside seamlessly. Therefore, re-skilling of the workforce becomes important. For example, as per Vanson Bourne research Realize 2030, 54% of Indian leaders believe they will have more job satisfaction by offloading tasks we don’t want to do to intelligent machines.

All these technologies hold promise in time to come. At Akamai, we’re thinking ahead to 2020 in fact. In the area of blockchain for example, we entered into a partnership with MUFG, one of the world’s leading financial groups, to offer a new blockchain-based online payment network enabling next-generation payment transaction scale and responsiveness. This hyper-scale payment network, powered by an innovative and newly-developed blockchain architecture, is designed to be capable of processing more than one million transactions per second at latencies of less than two seconds per transaction. The underlying blockchain architecture is expected to be extensible to 10 million transactions per second. MUFG and Akamai intend to leverage the technology, built and deployed on the Akamai Intelligent Platform, to offer a new payment network expected to be available in Japan during the first half of 2020.


We typically have no direct relationship with the end users whose privacy GDPR is intended to protect. Our approach to security differs from most typical cloud providers. For example, we do not have a “primary"" and a “backup"" datacentre that we could lock down in a traditional way.

However, with multi-fold growth in the cyberattacks in India, securing readily available digital assets becomes pertinent. Akamai has been in discussions with the Digital India stakeholders and several state governments’ online citizen services initiatives to secure government sites and accelerate workloads.


According to the Ponemon Report, 2018, cyberattacks cause costly application downtime, loss of customers and involvement of IT security that can result in an average cost of $1.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.1 million annually, respectively.


Rapid advancements in AI and ML are becoming key equalising factors. In order to identify and mitigate these threats, artificial intelligence and machine learning can help detect if a user is human. Behavioural biometrics, such as studying how you hold a device and how you tap can be used to learn what is human. Thus leveraging AI and ML to increase capabilities and capacity of the workforce becomes mandatory."

Pulwama and the subsequent Balakot airstrikes have solidified support for BJP in the cities of Gujarat


Signs of a clear rift between urban and rural Gujarat first emerged in the 2017 assembly elections. More than half of BJP’s 99 seats in the 2017 state election came from cities. On the other hand, a majority of Congress’ 77 victories were registered in rural areas. Pulwama and the subsequent Balakot airstrikes have only solidified that festering divide. Farmers like Mukesh Vasani in the rural hinterlands of Saurashtra will essentially hold the key to BJP’s fortunes in a region which will hold much symbolic value come 23 May. In 2014, the BJP swept the state, winning all of Gujarat’s 26 Lok Sabha seats.


“In the state’s rural regions, people are not interested in the nationalist rhetoric,"" says senior Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia. “We don’t see anything less than ten seats… all drawn from rural and Adivasi dominated regions,"" he adds.


A senior BJP leader, who has been pushed to the sidelines, says the Lok Sabha contest is likely to be tough since the Congress has done its homework and has “properly picked up its candidates"". “You can say they are serious this time, unlike in the past,"" he says.


Having said that, BJP’s biggest advantage in the state is a well-oiled network that goes right up to the municipal ward level, which has been painstakingly built over the last 20 years, he says. “The page pramukh is not just a designation. Every such page pramukh is supposed to give a daily account of the work he has done. The system demands it. Sometimes, even if a candidate is bad, the network often takes care of it,"" the BJP leader adds.


Because of the presence of two vastly different world views within the geographic boundary of one state, BJP’s assessment of the “mood"" can still lead it to believe that winning all 26 parliamentary seats yet again is a distinct possibility. Meanwhile, the Congress holds on to the hope that it will manage to make a significant dent.


In Gujarat, the 14 February Pulwama attack and India’s post-Pulwama retaliatory airstrikes uncannily revived the harrowing memories of the February 2002 Godhra train attack and the post-Godhra massacres. The saffron party rode to power in 2002 on the back of a Hindutva surge, particularly in urban Gujarat. But with cracks developing in rural areas, the outcome of the Lok Sabha elections is likely to be a curious mix of 2002 and 2017."

They said along with VRR gaining momentum, there is also reasonable certainty on the political front and the economy in terms of growth and inflation. Nitesh Ranjan, general manager (treasury operations), Union Bank of India, said introduction of VRR to get long-term funds is a trigger for the surge in inflows. “Coupled with this (VRR) is RBI’s announcement of the foreign exchange swap, which will decrease hedging cost for FPIs. Moreover, it is certain that rate hikes in US will not happen, rather a rate cut is possible and, therefore, India becomes attractive,"" he said.


Vaswar Mitra, country treasurer (India), Barclays, argued in a Mint column on 6 March that the balanced development of bond markets can be best achieved when regulators design and implement a comprehensive and consistent regulatory framework for FPIs. “Both FPIs and debt issuers will welcome VRR as a structural step towards broadening and deepening onshore bond markets,"" said Mitra.

New Delhi: Portable PCs, be they notebooks, ultrabooks or 2-in-1s, are typically designed for higher performance, but not for full-time connectivity and long-lasting battery life. Hence, manufacturers have started using the chipsets in high-end smartphones to provide these additional features in PCs, too.


Qualcomm’s flagship chipset from 2017, Snapdragon 835, is a case in point. Used in several high-end smartphones, the chipset already powers two Windows-based 2-in-1s—the NovaGo by Asus and Envy x2 by HP. Its X16 LTE modem offers internet speeds of up to 1Gbps on a PC, even when users have no access to wired or wireless internet. Its other advantage is improved battery performance—the NovaGo claims a backup of up to 22 hours on video playback and 30 days in standby, or sleep mode, which is quite rare in existing PCs."

"Given the problem at hand, Modi last month hinted that the scope and expanse of PM-Kisan may be increased. The government believes that the scheme will provide ₹7.5 trillion over the next 10 years and benefit 90% of farmers.


Interestingly, the scheme has become the subject of a political slugfest with the BJP alleging that opposition-ruled states have gone slow on implementing it, while the states governed by the BJP and its allies such as UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have made it a priority.


The government sees a lot of potential in the scheme as was articulated by Vivek Agrawal, chief executive officer of PM-Kisan in an interview. Agrawal said that a ₹6,000 per annum extra income will help towards building large assets for cold-chain, storage and grading house and creating infrastructure that would add value to the marketing efforts of the produce.


“I see it moving forward, not maybe as a budget outlay but as a scheme that would add a lot of value to the farmer’s activity and farming activity in the country,"" Agrawal said, adding, “I am very hopeful that an assured income that may seem to be small primarily can really turn around farmers’ thinking towards long-term planning, long-term asset creation or collective pooling of resources.""


While the numbers from the Union budget show that allocation for the agriculture ministry rose from ₹57,600 crore in 2018-19 (budget estimate) to ₹1.41 trillion in 2019-20, the increase is largely accounted by the ₹75,000 crore income transfer scheme, while funding for flagship farm schemes, except that on interest subsidy on crop loans, took a hit.

Bihar is one of the largest states in terms of seats where the two national alliances have locked horns, and the outcome of the contest will also have an impact on the assembly elections due next year.


Senior leaders of the NDA are confident that the combined popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Nitish Kumar will be crucial to ensure it retains its dominance in the state where the alliance had won 31 out of 40 seats in 2014. The BJP is pinning its hopes on issues such as the airstrikes in Balakot, the earlier surgical strike in 2016, and 10% reservation for general category as some of its key campaign strategies.


“National security is the biggest issue for the people of Bihar and they realise the importance of the NDA government at the centre.

Rahul Kumar, a software engineer in Noida, is flooded with marketing calls and messages from unknown numbers every day. Despite using an app that can identify such messages and calls and block them, a new unwanted call or text message pops up on his phone’s screen frequently.


Kumar isn’t alone in his exasperation with mobile marketing spam. According to a December 2018 report by Truecaller, India was second on the list of countries worst affected by spam calls last year. Another survey by online community platform LocalCircles shows 96% of Indians get promotional text messages every day and half of them reported getting 4-7 such messages on a daily basis. In case of spam calls, the Truecaller report claims that 91% of them are made by operators themselves, while in case of messages, banks are allegedly the biggest spammers.

In 2018, the researchers from Kaspersky Labs came across multiple zero day vulnerabilities in Office and informed Microsoft about them.


Interestingly, none of the most exploited vulnerabilities were found in Office itself, but were actually detected in related components. For instance, two of the most exploited vulnerabilities CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 didn’t afflict the Word directly but were targeted at Office equation editor process (it allows users to construct math and science equations)."

"Odd it may sound, but in these parts donning saffron and working for the BJP is an act of resistance. For a party charged with weakening of democratic institutions at a national level, the BJP is campaigning to “restore democracy"" in Bengal. “The sentiments of the majority population have been hurt by Mamata Banerjee... we are not allowed to take out astra michil (procession with swords) on Ram Navami,"" argues Bidyasagar Chakraborty, district president of the BJP, during a lunch break between campaigning. “You can forget what happened in 2014, the BJP won’t advance step by step... we will arrive in Bengal like a storm like we did in Assam and Tripura,"" he adds.


The BJP is expecting to breach Bengal despite the party lacking a leader who can match the stature of Mamata Banerjee, who stormed to power in 2011 on the back of violent land rights agitations, dislodging 34 uninterrupted years of left rule. But despite her earthy charisma and pro-poor image, the ground beneath Banerjee’s feet seems to be slipping fast. The electorate speak well of her pet schemes such as cycles for students, financial assistance for the girl child, and subsidized food grains, yet they seem eager to vote for change.


“No political party has been able to address the core issues raised by the BJP, which is equating India with monolithic Hinduism,"" says Amitava Chowdhury, a public health practitioner from the Sundarbans delta, and a keen observer of Bengal politics. “In Bengal, Mamata’s primary area of influence is south Bengal, which she cemented through her struggle for people’s rights. The party spread in the rest of the state through opportunistic elements whose primary objective was to make money, which led to anger on the ground.""


According to Derek O’Brien, senior TMC leader and a member of Rajya Sabha, the BJP may emerge as the main opposition party in Bengal replacing the Left but “Trinamool will win big… who comes second, third or fourth is not out concern"". On the subject of corruption, O’Brien hits back: “The BJP is the most corrupt political party in the world. The more they throw muck on us, the more we will win bouquets of appreciation from the people who will give the BJP a big zero in Bengal.""


In the 2014 elections, the BJP won just two of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, compared to 34 won by the TMC, its best performance ever. But in 2019, the saffron party has set itself a steep target of winning 23 seats, hoping to recover some of its expected losses in Hindi heartland states. How close or far it will end up from the target will depend on several factors, most importantly, by how much vote share of Left parties and the Congress collapses in a bipolar contest. In 2014, the Left front and the Congress together polled close to 40% votes, while the TMC and the BJP increased their vote share to 40% and 17%, respectively.


Though, the average Left voter seems to have changed sides, the Muslim voter is strongly behind the TMC. “Bengali Muslims stagnated during the Left rule, but under Mamata their economic and social mobility went up,"" says Prasanta Chattopadhyay, editor of the Bengali periodical Kalodhwani. “Muslims are participating more in civil society activities, they are vying for mainstream jobs, they have assumed leadership positions at local party levels... this has antagonized the bhadralok (elite) and the BJP is exploiting this situation by terming it as appeasement,"" he said, adding that in at least 28 Lok Sabha seats the Muslim voters will play a determining role. This is likely to offset some of the losses to the TMC as far as anti-incumbency is concerned.


But what explains the erstwhile Left voter taking an ideological leap to vote for a right-wing party in the elections? “You can expect cadres to be regimented, but not voters... still we expect to hold on to a majority of our vote share,"" said Pradip Roy, a district level secretary of the CPM."
"The latest poll also shows less than 10 percent of the total contributors with a year-ahead view now expect the rupee to breach its all-time low of 74.485 per dollar hit on Oct. 11.

A separate Reuters poll showed bets against the rupee rose to their highest since early December, dampened by oil's resurgence and election risks.

"While Jet investors await more details, the good news for the industry is that the skies are clearer now in contrast to the cost pressures faced last year. 2019 started on a good note with a big relief coming from lower aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices, as crude oil prices are relatively lower at the moment.


The pricing scenario, too, seems to be healthier. On yields, “the better environment that we had in November and December has continued so far"", said IndiGo on 23 January in its call.


“Our air fare tracker, which shows a 15-day advance air fare of 653 domestic routes, states average industry yield improved ~15% year-on-year during January-February 2019 on declining capacity of Jet Airways,"" said analysts from Elara Securities (India) Ltd in its SpiceJet results review report on 11 February.


For all we know, if airfares persist with healthy trends and crude prices remain lower, the current quarter may turn out to provide a far bigger surprise than the December quarter. That should offer ample support to aviation stocks to enjoy a good flight.


Jet, of course, is a peculiar case as mentioned earlier, and its shares will move in tandem with developments on the liquidity situation."
"""That population is going to need to upskill, reskill or change jobs fast,"" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings and lead author of the report.


Muro said the timeline for the changes could be ""a few years or it could be two decades."" But it's likely that automation will happen more swiftly during the next economic downturn. Businesses are typically eager to implement cost-cutting technology as they lay off workers.


Some economic studies have found similar shifts toward automating production happened in the early part of previous recessions and may have contributed to the ""jobless recovery"" that followed the 2008 financial crisis.


But with new advances in artificial intelligence, it's not just industrial and warehouse robots that will alter the American workforce. Self-checkout kiosks and computerized hotel concierges will do their part.


Most jobs will change somewhat as machines take over routine tasks, but a majority of US workers will be able to adapt to that shift without being displaced."
"So, while the Sensex may have reached touching distance of the 40,000-mark, returns from the Indian markets haven’t been all that impressive, when seen in relation to the S&P 500 index, which is made up of the world’s largest corporations.


An investment in the S&P 500 index grew at an annual average rate of 17.11% in rupee terms in the past decade. By comparison, the Nifty 500 index delivered returns of 15.46%, shows a Mint study.


Two things emerge when one scrutinizes the performances. The US market has been in the midst of the longest bull market in its history, despite Indian markets offering ample opportunities for domestic investors. The S&P 500 in dollar terms has, in the past decade, grown an annual 13.51%, thanks in part to the expanding US economy. But a key reason why the S&P 500 index outclasses the Indian market is the Indian currency’s depreciation. In the last decade, the rupee has depreciated approximately 37% against the dollar."

"The survey data shows that 75 percent of the urban youth (millennials and post-millennials) reported to be either regular voters or said they are likely to vote this time. The same proportion among the older generation was slightly higher (81 percent) among older men and women.


Among the youth, BJP enjoys greater support among regular voters (those who said they always vote) but among first-time voters (those who hadn’t voted in the past but intend to vote now), non-BJP parties enjoy greater support.


While the BJP enjoys support across individuals belonging to different income groups, the support is higher among the affluent than among the less well-off. 55% of those from relatively affluent households (household income above ₹75,000 per month) expressed support for the BJP while among those who belonged to relatively poorer families (those with family income below ₹20,000 per month), the support was lower at 47%. Non-BJP parties collectively enjoy greater support (53%) among the latter group.


The survey data does not reveal much differences in caste-based support for BJP and non-BJP parties but this could be partly because of non-response. Among respondents who choose not to reveal their caste identity, support for non-BJP parties is far higher than that for the BJP."

One explanation that fund managers offer is that fixed income funds, especially gilt funds, have been facing outflows since the beginning of 2018, which has triggered selling in government bonds. “The duration risk is high given the outlook on interest rates.

"The stagnation in average rural wages which grew at just 3.8% in nominal terms in December 2018 shows that non-farm rural incomes have slumped too, due to a surfeit in rural labour supply.


“In the past few years falling incomes have remained the key issue for farmers across India alongside rising input prices and debt levels. In the northern states the issue of stray cattle menace is a major problem for farmers,"" said Yogendra Yadav, a farmer leader and former political scientist.


The government launched the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) in September last year to ensure remunerative crop prices for farmers. But as the scheme failed to improve farm revenues, it launched an income transfer scheme for small and marginal farmers called the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, or PM-Kisan, in the February budget to win back the support of disgruntled farmers ahead of general elections.


Under this scheme, small and marginal farmers who own less than five acres of land will receive three instalments of ₹2,000 each every year. It is expected to form a major part of the BJP’s electoral campaign along with the issue of minimum support price (MSP), with the government agreeing to farmers’ demands by fixing the MSP of 22 crops at one-and-a-half times their input costs.


“Rural distress has worsened under this government despite the schemes it has launched with much fanfare. But the BJP government has successfully arrested its free fall after losing in state elections by making national security a poll issue. But we are not sure if this will override other major issues like employment in the general elections,"" Yadav added.


Elections 2019 has seen a shift in the narrative with the Pulwama terror attack and the subsequent Indian Air Force strikes in Balakot, Pakistan, overshadowing issues related to development, jobs and the farm crisis.


“There may be a lot of excitement (among voters) following the air strikes on Pakistan but those are for city dwellers... for the average farmer low prices of crops is a daily reminder of the crisis in agriculture,"" said Amrit Ram Patidar, a farmer from Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where five farmers died in police firing in 2017 after a farmers’ strike turned violent."

"The popularity of leadership, the strength of the party and the work done by the government will be BJP’s main poll plank, says Gadkari


Union minister says all alliances happen because of the convenience of two political parties. The criticism made by Shiv Sena leadership are a thing of the past now


NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari is often in the spotlight not just for the development work of his three ministries—transport, water resources and shipping —but also for his political heft as a former chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Soon after the announcement of Lok Sabha polls, Gadkari, in an interview, spoke about the work of his ministries, issues in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, regional politics in Maharashtra, alliance with Shiv Sena as well as national issues like unemployment and rural distress. Edited excerpts:


The general elections have been announced; what are the major issues that you think will play a decisive role in the polls?


During elections, the performance of the Union government is assessed by the people and the assessment is done at all levels. The assessment of the government’s work and performance in the five years in also discussed for a healthy democracy. It is for the people to decide on the performance of the government and there should be healthy competition on the good work done.


I can confidently say that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has succeeded in achieving what was not done by any government in the last 50 years. For example, all the saints who visited Kumbh in Prayagraj said that Ganga was clean this time. The cleaning processes have only done 30% work although discussion over cleaning of Ganga happened since 1980s. The government has made a commitment that Ganga will be 100% clean by the end of March 2020. The concept of express highways did not exist in the country, we have built a 14-lane express highway in Delhi. The Delhi-Meerut road will be completed by April. People used to talk about waterways but we have done work on 10 waterways.


BJP and Shiv Sena have finally decided to contest together, how did the two parties agree, because the Shiv Sena had passed a resolution that it won’t contest elections with BJP.


The BJP decided to continue with all the alliance partners in NDA in the general elections. And then we held individual discussions with all stakeholders of NDA. There were certain compromises made because there are so many political parties. If all political parties had similar views then we would all have been part of the same political party. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis handled the situation and talks with Shiv Sena well and we were successful in our attempts. As a result of this alliance, we would be able to perform well in Maharashtra."

"Thanks to partnerships with culinary-focused websites such as Zagat and Infatuation, Google knows a lot about restaurants: everything from how crowded or noisy they might be to how they resonate with particular dietetic needs. And it’s constantly stringing together patterns about what you like, based on where you’ve gone (or venues you’ve researched) in the past. Enter the Match Score, which combines all that intel to predict how likely you are to enjoy a particular place. It launched in May and is currently restricted to restaurants, but it could potentially expand to venues such as hotels.


How to use it: Find your match score by expanding a venue listing in Google Maps—it appears as a percentage rating next to a circular logo, right next to the overall star rating that you’ve always known to look for. Want to make it smarter? Head to your preferences settings; here, you can teach Google all about your favourite food types, whether that means “notable coffee"" or “Scandinavian"" or “Kosher."" (The options can be found under Settings > Exploring Places > Food and Drink on Android, or Settings > Food and Drink on iPhone.)


A further way to train Google’s algorithm is to “save"" places on Google Maps—it shows the tool what most interests you. Do that by clicking the bookmark icon on any listing. Then, when you’re in Explore mode on Maps, you’ll see a growing number of personalized recommendations in a tab called “For You,"" which works in any city, no matter where you go.


If you use a Gmail address to confirm your flight bookings, Google has a clear sense of when you’re travelling—and where. Since it also has access to such things as Federal Aviation Authority data, historic flight-status data, and geo-positional aircraft data, it can also tell you whether those plans are on the verge of being delayed. “Our models can come up with incredibly accurate predictions,"" Holden said recently during a panel discussion at Skift Forum, an annual travel conference. “We’re getting a lot of customers telling us that we’re notifying them before the carrier or anyone else.""


How to use it: The most important step is using a Gmail address so that Google can be alerted to your flight confirmations and track them accordingly. Then, in the days and hours leading up to your flight, simply type “My Flight"" or the actual flight number into your browser; you’ll see status updates that are more up-to-the-minute than anywhere else. (Push notifications may come down the line.)"

"While that’s in line with industry standards for flagships today, what’s worth noting is that Samsung’s fast-charging technology is amongst the slower ones out there. The S10 doesn’t charge as fast as a OnePlus or Oppo phone.


On the other hand, the S10 can wirelessly charge any device that supports Qi wireless charging. You simply need to turn on the phone’s wireless charging feature, and put a device on its back. This can be useful for those who have the new iPhones, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds or other Qi supported devices.


Software: Samsung has often taken flak for the software on its device, but its new OneUI is well tuned. The interface may not impress everyone from a design point of view, but it’s intuitive enough to get used to easily.


Verdict: From the Galaxy S6 to S10 today, Samsung has made its flagship smartphones unique. The Galaxy S series is unique enough for one to want to stick to these devices. However, it’s not the best, fastest or the most affordable flagship out there. It’s certainly the most unique-looking flagship phone , but it’s more a jack of all trades and master of none. It has a decent camera, great performance, good battery life and great display, but there’s no one aspect where it can trump every other phone by a mile. You could argue that Samsung’s design does that, but whether you like a curved design depends on the user. "

"For the Indian public, Modi’s strong response to the Pulwama and Uri terrorist attacks have high recall value.

Odisha, which will see simultaneous elections, is also perhaps a state where the BJP could improve its tally from 2014. The Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal (BJD) won 20 out of 21 seats at the last national hustings.

"To counter BJP, opposition parties, led by the Congress, have been stressing on the government’s poor record in creating jobs and the widespread agrarian distress in the elections even as the Balakot air strikes continue to be a key issue.


“BJP has always maintained that there would be no compromise on issues related to national security and terrorism. It was a conscious decision to carry out surgical strikes and now air strikes after security personnel were killed in Pulwama. People were angry after the Pulwama attack, and there was a demand to act against terrorists and Pakistan. It’s a major shift in the government’s policy to act against terrorism and Pakistan,"" said a senior BJP leader who is part of the manifesto committee of the party.


In the 2014 elections, the key narrative of the party was development. Senior BJP leaders say that it is time for the BJP to present its report card to the people. In its five-year tenure, the Narendra Modi government has focused on programmes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, universal health and housing for all, among other initiatives."

While the opposition parties admit that the inability to form a pan-India alliance could cost them, senior TMC leaders said the primary issue for the 2019 general elections is to oust Prime Minister Modi.


“Our only focus is to defeat Modi. A lot of opposition parties, including TMC, are determined to remove him from power. We have not spoken of a pan-India alliance. Mamata Banerjee has always said that the party that is strongest in a particular state should take the lead in fighting Modi.

"The direct equity investments for a few are limited to unlisted companies, including those owned by their families


NEW DELHI: Fixed deposits and tax-free bonds seem to be among the most favoured financial investments for the political leaders fighting the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, while mutual funds and stocks also adorn the portfolios of many and some even have got shares of long-defunct firms like Kingfisher Airlines.


Shares of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the country's most valued company with a market capitalistion of over ₹8.82 lakh crore, can be found in the portfolios of several leaders, while stocks and mutual fund units of the firms from younger brother Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group are also a common sight, as per disclosures made in election affidavits of the contestants.


However, some top leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have no stock market or mutual fund exposure at all and their financial savings are limited to deposits in banks, tax-free bonds, insurance policies and instruments like National Savings Certificate.

"Mumbai: Just when it was thought Wipro Ltd had recovered from its growth problems, its March quarter (Q4) results have once again raised uncomfortable questions about revenue growth.


Revenue growth slowed just two quarters after acceleration. The sequential constant currency revenue growth stood at just 1% in Q4. In the previous two quarters it grew in the range of 2-3%. This is in contrast to the revenue acceleration theme investors are banking on.


Year-on-year growth rate declined marginally last quarter, unlike its peers, where growth rates had increased last quarter. As was the case with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, Wipro said it is seeing strong deal momentum and has a healthy pipeline, which should help it deliver better FY20 than FY19. However, mere 5.4% growth in FY19 means the bar is not high. TCS and Infosys clocked 11.4% and 9% growth, respectively, in FY19."
"The TUF FX505 is solidly built with a sandblasted metal finish (to avoid smudges) on the lid. It looks refreshing and compact with the thin bezel design that is fast becoming a trend in notebooks too, after smartphones.


At 362mm, it looks smaller than the predecessor (which measured over 380mm sideways) and would fit comfortably into a regular work backpack with ease. However, at 2.3kg, it is just about 100g lighter than that one.


What we also like about it is that unlike the ROG series, it isn’t crying out loud about its gaming roots—so instead of using flashy designs and eye catching backlighting, it has the more discreet X carving on the top with the regular Asus logo on back. The idea is to allow users to carry their laptops for work without feeling out of place or casual during meetings.


The 15.6 inch display retains the 1,920x1080p resolution of the predecessor, but looks a bit more vivid. The laptop also offers a slightly superior refresh rate of 144Hz, keeping screen tearing and frame lags during fast-paced shooting or racing games at bay. The matte coating on top is now common in most gaming laptops but still very useful as it puts less stress on the eyes, and is easier to use outdoors, compared to displays with glossy finish."
"It is a continuation of the resonance of an aspiring India through governance infrastructure. For the first time, there is a government, which is committed to fulfilling the expectations of the people. The track record shows that it has risen to fulfil the expectations. Firstly, zero corruption. Middlemen and dalals are not welcome in the corridors of powers in Delhi. Secondly, the government has laid emphasis on skill development and entrepreneurship. It has gone the extra mile in devising new ways to meet challenges as far as livelihood related issues are concerned and jobs are part of that. Thirdly, this government has shown that agriculture, rural development and issues related to marginal sections are equally important to raise the standard of living in urban areas. Most governments in the past were stuck in dilemmas, urban or rural. This government has struck a balance.


Internal security is everybody’s concern. We are here to promote national integrity, social cohesion, because the unity of the nation means making of a national mind. It happens only through measures to control all kinds of fragmentation tendencies—doing away with the sedition act or giving kid-glove treatment to those in the tukde-tukde gang (does not work). That is what we are doing. There are parties, which believe that India is a conglomeration of different nations. For instance, they say Jharkhand is a separate nation. If they raise their voice, we will have to raise our voice, too.


There are ample job opportunities in each of the 45 pages of the manifesto. The idea of creating 9-5 jobs is old-fashioned. Times have changed. In government parlance, we talk about livelihood opportunities. For example, promoting yoga globally would create hundreds of job opportunities for yoga teachers. Job creation should not be segregated from all other activities. Every activity should be conducted in such a way that it provides livelihood opportunities to young and aspiring India. That is what we have tried to do. In case of rural employment, we have gone miles ahead from the original MNREGA. It was a licence to corruption. Five years ago, if someone visited a village to see the work done under MNREGA, there was nothing to show on ground. Money just exchanged hands. Now, infrastructure required for village gram panchayats, roads and toilets, everything has been included under MNREGA. Human labour has been put to use for a productive cause. We have reformed it. Why should we mention it again?"

Congress will not perform well in this election. In the assembly elections, the vote share difference between the two parties was 0.5% which is less than two lakh votes. The issues that the Congress raised ahead of assembly elections – loan waivers and stipend for unemployed youth, made the people give them a chance. The reality is that 120 days since they came to power, farmers are yet to receive any money. Even the youth are still waiting for the promises made to them. The state government has not been able to implement the 10% quota for economically weaker sections which is also working against them. The leadership of Congress does not have a vision for the country.


Congress does not understand mathematics. ₹6000 is not sufficient for a family to survive. There isn’t a possibility of the Congress coming to power. Their alliances have failed in all states including Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal does not want an alliance with them, N Chandrababu Naidu does not want to give them one seat in Andhra Pradesh. How will they get enough seats to come to power?

"In Bihar, like in other states, the two major political alliances have built strategies around social groupings

Singh, a 25-year-old daily wage worker, lives near Vaishali, an ancient city considered one of the first examples of a republic dating back to the 6th century BC.


In Bihar, like in other states, the two major political alliances have built strategies around social groupings. Caste gains greater traction as the state has a history of political realignment through caste consolidation, and leaders draw support from specific groups.

"In past versions of the XB series, the bass would overpower everything else, making it difficult to hear other audio. In the WH-XB700, you still get decently loud bass, but without compromising the highs as much. Genres like rap, hip-hop and even some rock feel quite energetic, which is a good thing.


That said, while you can hear high frequencies better this time, the headphones still lack completely in the mid frequencies. The overall result is better clarity in sound than older XB series headphones, but still not something you would call perfect. It’s essentially a V-shaped sound signature, which means bass and highs are enhanced, while the mids are mediocre at best. It also doesn’t have wide soundstage.


Audio quality aside, the WH-XB700 borrows one feature from Sony’s higher end headsets. It supports the Google Assistant and Siri, depending on which phone you use.

"And social media companies may be quite happy about this. The primary objective of a social media company is engagement. Negative emotions like anger are triggered more easily and stay with us longer than positive ones. And here is an environment where you can get away with saying stuff that you won’t have the guts to or be ashamed to tell someone face to face. All the reward you can get from a social network is attention, and it’s a proven fact that the more obnoxious you are, the more attention you get.


Besides, there is the rising menace of fake news. All of us suffer from confirmation bias, and we tend to trust information that strengthens our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. And social media algorithms make sure that we are served messages that play to our confirmation biases, creating for all of us echo chambers that limit our horizons, and encourage our bigotries. We pass on false information without bothering to verify anything and spread divisive and often incendiary messages. This has sometimes led to violence and even murder of innocent people.


And we know, from the Russian attempts to rig the 2016 US presidential elections, that social media can be manipulated at a very low cost. All you need is some ingenuity about how to game the system.


As the world celebrates 30 years of the internet, one should look back at what the original visionaries dreamed of. They thought of the net as a wonderful tool that would connect common people of the world; allow them to freely exchange information and ideas; and be a great bottom-up force for global peace and democracy.


Large parts of the internet today are dominated by a few players. Companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft control much of the innovation and opportunities online and are shaping the online world and its use.


As the Internet Society says in its 2019 Global Internet Report (bit.ly/2WrRWda): “The development of new applications, services and businesses across the global economy is increasingly dependent on a small number of private platforms owned by the largest internet companies…(The) risk of growing societal dependencies…is magnified by exceptional economic power (of these companies). That a company or technology is vulnerable to disruption, evolution, and competition has been one of the internet’s defining successes—what the Internet Society calls the characteristic of ‘no permanent favourites’. This characteristic could be challenged as dependencies continue to grow.""


Whenever these companies see a startup creating an innovative service that could be a future competitor, they simply buy the firm. So, a user may shift from Facebook Messenger to WhatsApp, but WhatsApp is owned by Facebook. Many younger people are switching from Facebook to Instagram, but Facebook owns Instagram.


Will all innovation and potentially disruptive ideas then have to pass through the platforms and standards owned by this small number of corporations?


On the other hand, you have a totalitarian regime like China which has built the Great Firewall around its internet. Among the more than 10,000 sites that China blocks are Google, Bing, Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Netflix and, of course, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. So, the average Chinese citizen has the internet, but hardly any access to news, information, and opinions that have not been approved by the government."

Most cyber risk insurance plans provide coverage for losses that might occur due to unexpected cyberattacks, but there are some that cover physical damage to hardware too. Some insurance providers also give the option to personalise the plan in line with the company's business security requirements.


While cyber risk insurance can help companies minimise their losses, it is not an alternative to the company’s cybersecurity strategy. Cybersecurity experts are of the opinion that the kind of insurance cover a company qualifies for depends on the their cybersecurity efforts. Any insurance provider will first evaluate the strength of a company’s cybersecurity position before issuing a policy. Stronger effort towards cybersecurity can result in better coverage. Fragmented enterprise security can result in inadequate or poorly targeted insurance cover."

"In a blog post and a Washington speech, Smith painted a bleak vision of all-seeing government surveillance systems forcing dissidents to hide in darkened rooms “to tap in code with hand signals on each other’s arms.""


To avoid such an Orwellian scenario, Smith advocates regulating technology so that anyone about to subject themselves to surveillance is properly notified. But privacy advocates argue that’s not enough.


Such debates are already happening in states like Illinois, where a strict facial recognition law has faced tech industry challenges, and California, which in 2018 passed the nation’s most far-reaching law to give consumers more control over their personal data. It takes effect in 2020.


The issue could find new attention in Congress next year as more Republicans warm up to the idea of basic online privacy regulations and the incoming Democratic House majority takes a more skeptical approach to tech firms that many liberal politicians once viewed as allies — and prolific campaign donors.


The “leave them alone"" approach of the early internet era won’t work anymore, said Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat poised to take the helm of the House’s antitrust subcommittee.


“We’re seeing now some of the consequences of the abuses that can occur in these platforms if they remain unregulated without meaningful oversight or enforcement,"" Cicilline said.

"Choosing and changing pickups can be a bit tricky though, and should be done only when you’re hoping to get a new tone. If you do commit to changing them yourself, it will definitely make for a fun weekend.


Pickups are self-explanatory—they pick up the sound made by your guitar’s strings and convert it to an electrical signal that is further amplified via an amplifier. Your electric guitar’s tone depends almost entirely on the type of the pickups.


Fender’s guitar line-up comprising the iconic Telecaster and Stratocaster is characterised by a bright, woody and slightly ‘twangy’ tone which resonates, producing a “hum"". That’s because they come with single coil pickups that are built around a single coil of copper wire coiled around a single magnet. If you’re going for a tone similar to Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan or my personal favourite, John Mayer, you might want to go for these.


Gibson’s most popular guitar line-up, the Les Paul, comes with humbucker pickups that produce a warmer, quieter tone. The pickups have two coils or two magnets wound with copper wires next to each other that cancel out the “hum,"" hence the name humbucker. If you’re into metal music (Metallica, Megadeth, Avenged Sevenfold) that requires heavy distortion to create that really heavy, fuzzy tone, you should go for these.


These are not the only two pickup configurations and there are several hybrid setups consisting of H-S-S (humbucker-single coil-single coil) pickups which give you excellent versatility.


Seymour Duncan, Fender and Gibson are the major pickup brands you can choose from and they can cost anywhere upwards of ₹ 10,000. This is a major purchase, so you should really think through the kind of guitar playing style you want.


Once you’ve sorted out your pickups, let’s talk about amplifiers. Amplifiers increase the power of electrical signals coming out of your guitar’s pickup. Picking an amp mainly relies on where and why you would be playing your guitar—at home, practicing or at a concert, shredding."

"Is it not a mixture (coalition) in Maharashtra? Nitish Kumar was with the Mahagathbandhan, moved away, then returned and went again with the BJP. They can’t teach us. (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government had 27 parties. The thing is that Modi is taught cinema dialogues by RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and he says the same things. They (BJP) have the best actors who deliver the best dialogues but they do not have thinkers, intellectuals and have no vision. Because all they have done is lynchings, demonetization, reckless implementation of GST (goods and services tax) and lies despite having such a big majority. Those who have no vision for the country speak in this fashion.


This is all media creation and your imagination. Did anyone expect that he will become PM in 2014 or rule Gujarat for over 13 years? A few companies, corporates and media created him. Don’t think that there is no alternative after Modi. Everyone asked who will be there before Dr. Manmohan Singh or after Jawaharlal Nehru. In this country of 120 crore people, everybody will come forward.


We can’t say anything now but we have promised to go together and will try our best to complete all five years. There is discord (among workers) but now it is inevitable that we move together. When both want to protect secular liberties and fraternities, social justice... We must naturally go together.


There appears to be an effort by the BJP to drum up support by using nationalism. How do you respond?


They act like they are the only nationalists and patriots. Modi is saying all this because people are not happy with the election manifesto, his performance, GST, unemployment, farmers and he can’t face it so he is putting all this on nationalism. Does it mean to say that all other parties are anti-national? He is himself politicizing the armed forces by asking for votes in the names of jawans and blood spilt on the border."

"The phone: While Samsung’s apps for this entire ecosystem are optimized for their own Galaxy branded phones, you can download them on any Android or iOS device. That means if you’re investing in the Samsung ecosystem, you won’t need to change your phone to use it. The phone essentially acts as the bridge between all the products. On Samsung phones, you can use Bixby (the company’s voice assistant) to give commands to the products, just like you can do on the Family Hub. Bixby could, in future, be the one stop solution for controlling all the products through voice commands.


Verdict: There’s really no verdict you can give about such an ecosystem. The products are too expensive for most people, and many of the products aren’t even meant for regular homes. For instance, Samsung had to take the fridge’s doors apart to get it into our home, while the washing machine requires specific types of taps that many won’t have in their home.


However, the Family Hub, QLED TV and FlexWash together give us a glimpse into the future. At the moment, many of these features can feel redundant or even useless but, this is how things will work in future connected homes ."

"Healthcare companies are another major concern area. Through new software, companies have developed voice tools capable of handling patient information covered under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).


According to Adam Levin, Founder of CyberScout and author of ""Swiped"", ""Alexa is now making house calls and a treasure trove of medical data is being stored by this virtual assistant with major privacy and security implications. PHI or Protected Healthcare Information is a prime target for hackers who can use the data in a host of identity theft schemes or sell it on the dark web. There have already been reports of Alexa going rogue and recording private conversations and then sharing that information with contacts. What if the device shared confidential medical data?"" These new technical advances may make our lives easier, acknowledges Levin but cautions that as we see a greater pivot to privacy with GDPR and the fact that breaches have become third certainty in life, ""convenience should never trump consumer privacy and security"".

"Fondly called LoL in short by fans, the PC game has grown into the darling of the $13 billion global gaming industry since being released by Riot Games Inc. almost a decade ago. LoL mixes the elements of strategy-based and role-playing games and features monsters, mages and warriors that feel like they’ve been pulled out of medieval folklore. It’s no surprise the game has spawned new businesses from books and clothes to toys and accessories.


E-sports fans liken the LoL championship to the World Cup, pointing out it holds the record for the longest and largest viewership among game tournaments. Last year, 60 million people tuned in to watch the finals in Beijing, where team Samsung Galaxy defeated three-time champion SK Telecom T1, another team from South Korea.


This year marked the first time that no South Korean squad had reached the finals since 2011, even though it was played in the Asian country. Instead, Fnatic, a European team that had won the first championship held in Sweden, duked it out with Invictus Gaming, a Chinese organization also famous for its exploits in Dota 2 and StarCraft.


One team must win three matches to claim the title by destroying the other’s base, or “Nexus."" And of course, it’s easier said than done. It takes guts, quick thinking and teamwork on top of numerous hours of practice to beat another team that has put in as much devotion. Winners go on to hoist the coveted “Summoner’s Cup."""

Party hopes its ambitious universal basic income scheme can prove to be a game changer in the general election


The BJP leadership believes that the PM-Kisan scheme will help double farmers’ incomes by 2022, while the Congress plan also acknowledges the need for income support for the poorest


NEW DELHI: The idea of basic minimum income has taken root, with its form set to take shape by the outcome of the coming general election. While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to provide financial support to small and marginal farmers through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, or PM-Kisan scheme, the Congress has a more ambitious plan of providing ₹72,000 annually to at least 20% of India’s poorest families."

"However, for Motherson Sumi, there is a silver lining amid the gloomy forecasts of slowing auto sales. In a call with analysts, the management highlighted that BS-VI emission norms will translate into a 10-15% increase in the wiring harness requirements in automobiles. Motherson Sumi is well-positioned to cash in on this. The company also has a strong order book that promises revenue traction over the next two-three years across its international businesses.


Importantly, analysts are optimistic that Motherson Sumi’s capex plans would be lower in the quarters ahead, implying reduced borrowings, lower interest costs and improved cash flows.


True, the Motherson Sumi stock has been battered on account of weaker-than-expected profit margin in Q3. The pain may continue as the company wades through pressures of the auto sector slowdown and sweeping technological changes. But some of this has been factored into valuations that have fallen from 25 times one-year forward about a year ago to the present 18 times earnings."

Bengaluru: The dollar is losing some of its appeal, according to strategists polled by Reuters, who said the U.S. currency's fortunes have reversed in line with the Federal Reserve taking a dovish turn on rate hikes.


Last year, the dollar outperformed on higher rates and a robust economy. But it had already started turning down before the Fed's policy U-turn last week on worries that the U.S.-China trade war was putting downward pressure on growth.


The poll of 70 currency strategists taken Jan 31-Feb 6 showed the U.S. dollar is forecast to give up most of 2018's gains against major currencies over the coming year.

"Out of the 1.8 million people living in the Banswara district in 3.6 lakh households, 78% are tribals


Banswara, Rajasthan: When Ramchandar, 52, wakes up in his thatched house every morning in the hilly tribal village of Katumbi in Rajasthan's Banswara district, his first preoccupation is to fetch water from the nearest village at a distance of two kilometers. For the Bhil tribe who once fought for the Rajputs against the Mughals, water woe is not seasonal. Often riding pillion on the serpentine road behind his neighbour’s bike for which he pays for the fuel, Ramchandar wonders whether in this lifetime, he will see a permanent source of water near his house.


Out of the 1.8 million people living in the Banswara district in 3.6 lakh households, 78% are tribals. With a 46.1% literacy rate, 91.3% of households earn less than ₹5,000 per month, making them eligible for the NYAY scheme, the targeted basic income support scheme proposed by Congress president Rahul Gandhi.


Speaking at Dungurpur under the Banswara parliamentary constituency, which goes to polls on Monday, Gandhi said last Tuesday that NYAY would turn out to be his party’s “surgical strike"" on poverty. In 2014, BJP won all the 25 parliamentary seats in Rajasthan. However, in December 2018, the Congress made a comeback by winning the assembly election with a slender margin. While the Banswara parliamentary constituency has been a fortress of the Congress party in the past, the emergence of the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP), which is fighting parliamentary elections for the first time, has upset the calculations of both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party."

"Post Pulwama, there’s a general impression that south Kashmir is ground zero of Kashmir’s security situation. “There is militancy as it exists elsewhere,"" admits commentator and former editor Mohammad Sayeed Malik, “But spreading elections to three phases was seemingly a political decision. Maybe this decision-making suits some people, somewhere.""


South Kashmir has a fascinating political and social history. Perhaps that’s why the present situation puzzles academic Gull Mohammad Wani, who teaches political science at the University of Kashmir, and belongs to the region. “The region has been a cradle of Kashmir’s main pluralist space and has not changed much,"" Wani said. “Kulgam is considered to be the bastion of Jamaat-e-Islami but it is being represented by a Marxist Communist for the last two decades in the state assembly. To be honest, if there is some space that Congress can claim to be its own in Kashmir that also falls in south Kashmir."" Even for the BJP, the region offers a small chunk of votes every election.


People may be surprised that the “restive"" region was the last to get fascinated by the gun. “The new situation that inflicted north and central Kashmir took many years to reach south,"" Wani said. “Still, it was a lukewarm response."" In Kashmir, it was Anantnag that was taken over by the counter-insurgency grid, with Ikhwanis, the “friendliest"" surrogate soldiers, controlling it up to 2000. Ikhwanis, also known as “friendlies"", created its many bastions across north and central Kashmir much later.


There is an instance of an overnight communal rioting on 20 February 1986, when 129 homes belonging to Kashmiri Pandits were damaged and 16 temples ransacked. Despite the perception damage caused by that event, Kashmiri Pandits, Sikhs, Deabandis, Barealvis, Mirzaisand Jamaatis, almost all faiths, sects and variants continue to co-exist in south Kashmir.


Congress was born in Srinagar but was rooted in south Kashmir. Syed Mir Qasim, Mufti Sayeed and many Congress veterans belonged to the region. Of the 10 chief ministers since 1947, four belonged to south Kashmir. In 1952, the man who negotiated with Pandit Nehru, the famous Delhi Agreement, was Mirza Afzal Beig, a resident of Anantnag. In 2014, the man who negotiated with BJP the controversial Agenda of Alliance was Dr Haseeb Drabu, a resident of Pulwama.


The big change in the region came when Mufti Sayeed left the Congress and floated PDP in 1998. In 2002, when the party contested its maiden election on human rights plank, the region gave it 10 of 16 seats. With Congress and BJP supportive of his thought process, Sayeed managed to contribute to the ground situation positively. “When Mufti Sayeed took over, the idea was to withdraw the disturbed area act from the region because there was no militant violence,"" Wani said, insisting, “Later when Omar Abdullah replaced him, the idea was alive and was being favourably looked at.""


In 2008, PDP got 12 seats from the region simply on the basis of its earlier term. However, an NC-Congress alliance kept Mufti in opposition for six years. By early 2014, when PDP swept all the three Lok Sabha seats across Kashmir, BJP had risen with Narendra Modi as the leader. Given the BJP’s aggressive politics, this time Mufti sought a decisive mandate against the right wing party. The region gave him 13 seats in the assembly polls. Post-polls, he took more than two months to negotiate and finally shook hands with the BJP. Then all hell broke loose.

"BJP seen integrating 'Jai Jawan', 'Jai Kisaan' in its poll narrative for general elections, as well as the development agenda


Congress seen focusing on jobs, farm distress and Rafale deal to corner the Modi govt in the run-up to Elections 2019


New Delhi: On a recent tour of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Prime Minister Narendra Modi probably inadvertently (or purposely) gave away the possible election slogan “Modi Hai to Mumkin Hai"", when he highlighted his decisive action against terrorists in Pakistan after the Pulwama attack, besides other achievements of his government.


The slogan was repeated a number of times by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath at an event in Greater Noida on 9 March. Now that the election dates have been announced by the Election Commission, all government advertising, which had thus far used the tagline ""Namumkin Ab Mumkin Hai"", will cease.


“The Modi Namumkin-Mumkin report card blitz of the past weeks has got almost every ministry to do a recount of achievements and milestones. Tonnes of money has been spent on that entire effort, though technically it is a Government of India campaign and not the BJP’s (Bharatiya Janata Party’s). But Modi will now have to focus…choose one or two most important issues that may eventually swing the votes,"" said Sandeep Goyal, an advertising and media veteran."

The conversation has swung between national security and economic stagnation. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has adopted national security and terrorism as key talking points and has been reluctant to address India’s real economic problems. This is understandable at two levels: first, acknowledging the problem is admitting it occurred on their watch and, second, it is conceding they scored a self goal because many economic problems today emanated from demonetisation.


Yet, conscious of the problems that are pulling the Indian economy down, the BJP has tried to offer some solutions."

Besides, a superior performance under the new leadership has already been factored in by the Axis Bank stock when Chaudhry took over in January.

"A wall outside Gandhi’s main campaign office in Gauriganj is painted with the slogan “Amethi ka MP, 2019 ka PM (Amethi’s MP is the PM for 2019)"", referencing the fact that this election is a presidential-style contest between Rahul Gandhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Congress has staked its chances on a combined pitch of farm loan waivers and NYAY, or the Nyuntam Aay Yojana, to guarantee a minimum income. In Amethi, even Gandhi’s most vocal supporters don’t believe it can be implemented.


“The scheme to provide ₹72,000 a year sounds good on paper but I don’t think it is realistic. Even though our support is for Gandhi, we know that promises like these are made but not fulfilled,"" said Mohammad Azam Khan, a farmer near Musafirkhana.


Voters and senior party leaders believe that for Gandhi, the road to Delhi passes through this pocket borough in eastern Uttar Pradesh even though he may have picked a second seat of Wayanad in Kerala this time. Amethi is a prestige fight to retain a seat that has been with the Gandhi family for over three decades.


The choice of a second seat has divided sentiments. While his supporters believe Gandhi was trying to motivate party cadre, others say he is afraid of losing. “He went to Wayanad because he wants to bridge the gap between the north and the south. Supporters like us are now competitive and will work harder. We want his winning margin in Amethi to be far higher than in Wayanad,"" said Shah Bahadur, who owns a bike repair shop in Amethi.


Friends, enemies and observers have all speculated that Gandhi picked the “safe seat"" of Wayanad because he was not sure of winning Amethi. Irani, who put up a spirited fight in 2014, narrowed his margin of victory to just 12.33%. In previous elections, Gandhi romped home with a margin of 50% or more.


“If there was no fear of losing, why did he leave? Why Kerala? He is contesting against the communists because he cannot take on the BJP. Agar ladna tha toh Gujarat jaa kar ladte (if he really wanted to fight, he should have gone to Gujarat),"" said Hari Om Mishra, a 24-year-old from Amethi who works in the merchant navy and is home to vote on Monday.


Nearly 3km from Gandhi’s campaign office is the recently opened office of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gauriganj, which is also Irani’s campaign centre. It’s a bustling office, full of party workers and volunteers who seem to have a clear sense of purpose. One group of party workers is setting out to distribute pamphlets, another to set up and participate in small meetings. The BJP’s methodical approach is on display, and it is this campaign machine that the Congress is up against in most of the country."
"Perhaps, lowering goods and services tax on under-construction projects—an expectation that was not met in the budget—will help bring down property prices.

Until then, equity investors in the sector may continue to be on a shaky foundation."
"Easy to set up: Though compact in size, the speaker is not fully portable. It needs constant power supply. The initial setup is simple and can be done through the Amazon Alexa app (free on Android and iOS). Once connected, one can use the app as the interface for the speaker, to teach and enable new skills and games, add smart home devices to it and link the account to more audio streaming services such as Saavn and TuneIn (it doesn’t support Apple Music, Google Play Music or Google Podcasts). Speaking to Alexa is a breeze as it can detect and respond to the Indian accent quite well.

"Great pictures are essential for any top-end phone. Samsung has equipped the S10 with three rear-facing cameras—one for close-ups, one for standard shots, and an ultra-wide one for expansive scenes. The iPhone has two lenses, however, which on paper seems to put it at a disadvantage. The truth is that lenses alone don’t determine the quality of the picture, and Apple has always preferred a “quality before quantity"" approach to features, but having three lenses to play with instead of two should win over creatives for the sheer versatility.


The S10 has a massive 6.4-inch screen, but the iPhone XS Max’s is slightly bigger at 6.5 inches. However, the industry standard “notch"" atop the iPhone’s display is not something Samsung adopted. Instead, the S10 has an unusual “hole punch"" design for its front-facing cameras. This gives the display an asymmetrical profile, but it also increases the usable space.


One of the reasons Apple includes a larger notch in its design is because it houses advanced facial-recognition features for keeping its devices secure; the FaceID technology requires multiple sensors to function, and currently that means it needs to eat into more of the display.


Samsung hasn’t ignored security, though—it’s baked a fingerprint reader underneath the screen itself. It uses ultrasound to detect the gaps between the ridges on a user’s finger, which Samsung said makes it more secure than a traditional sensor."

For instance, Section 505 of the IPC has provisions to penalise disinformation while Sections 290 and 153A of the IPC have provisions if the disinformation is being used to create communal strife. CIS has also flagged the scope of the term unlawful as it is not clearly defined, leaving room for broad interpretation. On the traceability clause, CIS draws attention to the lack of clarity on whether it applies on just social media platforms and messaging services or all intermediaries.


This can be a bit of problem for ISPs which may have no access to contents of an encrypted communication sent and received on its network.


The traceability clause, which requires intermediaries to use automated tools to trace the person posting unlawful content, came in for a lot of criticism. While the Ministry in an official tweet in January 2018 clarified that it only requires intermediaries to trace the origin of messages which lead to unlawful activities without breaking encryption, experts believe it isn’t possible without lowering encryption standards or building a backdoor to access encrypted communications.


Amnesty International slammed the clause, arguing, “While governments can legitimately use electronic surveillance to protect people from crime, forcing companies to weaken encryption will affect all users’ online privacy. Such measures would be inherently disproportionate, and therefore impermissible under international human rights law."""

M.A. Pandya, the district collector and administrative head of Porbandar district, declines to comment on the number of fishermen in the custody of Pakistani authorities, saying the central government continues to engage with the Pakistan government on this issue.


Fishermen from Porbandar, which is about 250 nautical miles from the Pakistan port of Karachi, often cross into international waters and are caught by the authorities of the neighbouring country. But it’s not always that the fishermen are unaware of the boundary line—environmental pollution, climate change, overfishing and greed are also the reasons why they fish in troubled waters and end up arrested by the Pakistan Navy.

Immediately after BJP presented its manifesto, all of their leaders went home without even taking a single question. No answers on their five years?,"" tweeted senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel.

Dabas pointed out that while the Red Label Kumbh ad (more so an accompanying tweet which highlighted how some people abandon their elderly parents at Kumbh) perhaps went wrong in correctly representing what the holy festival stands for; the Surf Excel campaign is a shining example of how brands should take exemplary stances and stick by them.

These services were so far limited to Apple products and the company has a small market share in India. Indian consumers can now enjoy the Apple services on Samsung smart TVs.


If Apple bring its content offerings to more TVs and other streaming products, it may lead to the end of its own streaming box, the Apple TV. While Apple has been selling Apple TVs for sometime, cheaper products such as the Amazon Fire TV Stick, Google Chromecast and Roku streaming boxes have hurt its market in this segment.

"I’m personally not a fan of gradient colours, but I’m not sure how Huawei gets it right every time. The Nova 3i is one of the prettiest smartphones not only in the sub-Rs 20,000 range but also in the premium categories. The two-tone gradient looks elegant and understated. It’s not tacky but makes you stand out at the same time—a very difficult balance to strike.


But it’s not all looks and no hooks— it runs a very capable Kirin 710 chipset underneath that two-tone skin and comes with a beautiful display, ample RAM and storage. It is marred, however, by its UI, which is a common letdown in all Huawei and Honor phones. You can bandage the eyesore with a launcher though. It runs Android Oreo 8.1 and while Huawei hasn’t announced a Pie update for the phone, it may be safe to assume it might get one in the first quarter of January.

For airlines, yield is a relevant pricing measure and refers to passenger ticket revenue divided by revenue passenger kilometres flown.


“We saw a much better revenue performance (per available seat kilometre) in November and December. This improvement in our performance was largely because of improvement in yields, especially in the 0-15 day booking window during these months,"" IndiGo’s management said in its post earnings conference call.

"The defence of democracy and democratic traditions, both within the party and nationally, has been a proud hallmark of the BJP, Advani said on Thursday, just two days before the foundation day of the party. The party was formed on 6 April 1980. Advani, a former deputy prime minister, is one of the founders of the party and had represented the Gandhinagar constituency in Gujarat six times since 1991.


“Right from its inception, the BJP has never regarded those who disagree with us politically as our enemies, but only as our adversaries. Similarly, in our conception of Indian nationalism, we have never regarded those who disagree with us politically as anti-national. The party has been committed to freedom of choice of every citizen at personal as well as political level,"" Advani said.


Advani’s comment comes amid a raging political debate on the idea of nationalism and anti-nationals. Senior leaders of the BJP have often said that the 2019 general elections should be contested on the idea of nationalism.


Another senior leader who was denied an election ticket is former Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi. The former BJP chief who represents Kanpur issued a statement in March that he would not contest the Lok Sabha elections."

Digital platforms have been scrambling to devise strategies to tackle the spread of false information ahead of the election


New Delhi shop owner Ram Shankar Rai spends at least two hours a day going through political news and videos shared with him on social media.


Rai looked intently at a flurry of videos and photos on WhatsApp about an Indian airstrike in Pakistan, including pictures labeled as militants' corpses.


There was just one problem: The photos were not of militants but of casualties of a 2005 earthquake that killed thousands of people in Pakistan.


Before the world's largest democracy starts voting Thursday in a phased election carried out over six weeks, this attitude is posing a problem for election officials seeking to combat the spread of fake news among a population that experts say has proven highly susceptible to believing it.


Despite efforts by India's Election Commission to work with social media giants, urging them to tackle the spread of misinformation, at least one former top election official is warning that fake news could end up being the deciding factor in some constituencies with extremely tight races."

In AP, however, Naidu is facing a resurgent YSRCP as its leader Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s popularity rises. Jagan is the son of former AP chief minister Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy. While more than 20 MLAs and three MPs from YSRCP had defected to the TDP, which had won 102 seats in the 175-member assembly in the 2014 state elections, some of the defecters have since returned.


While TDP leaders from the state say their party might win a simple majority at best in the forthcoming assembly elections in AP, the TRS is now confident it will sweep 16 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana.


In Andhra Pradesh, the TDP had won 15 seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 2 and YSRCP 8 in the 2014 general election. In Telangana, the TRS managed to win 11 seats, the Congress party won 2, TDP 1, YSRCP 1, BJP 1 and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won 1 seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

"In this context, can indoor air purifiers help us breathe good quality air? According to Dr Nayar, air purifiers might filter the air but there is nothing to suggest that using them would actually help in reducing the incidence of health problems. For a typical adult who has to step out of his/her home daily, it will be difficult to assess the importance of indoor air purifiers. Dr Nayar also cautions that some purifiers emit ozone as a by-product, which causes more harm than good.


“Air purifiers control the level of indoor pollution significantly if appropriately used with recommended specifications. An ideal air purifier must have a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter and should run throughout the day for effective reduction,"" corroborates Dr Puneet Khanna, senior consultant and head (interventional pulmonology, respiratory and sleep medicine) at Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital, New Delhi.


To be sure, Dyson uses a 360-degree HEPA filter in its air purifiers to capture particulate matter as small as 0.1micron, harmful gases and VOC (volatile organic compounds). Its 350-degree oscillation allows it to project clean air in every corner of the room. Honeywell uses three layers of filtration in its air purifiers—pre-filters to remove PM10 and dust, HEPA filter to filter out PM 2.5 and finer dust particles, and the HiSiv filter to filter chemical, VOCs and even bad odour. “We often review filters from Indian homes to understand what pollutants are present,"" adds Hugo Wilson, senior design engineer, Dyson."

"The scale of consultations and its magnitude was different from previous manifesto exercises. During the framing of the last manifesto, Rahul Gandhi visited different parts of the country for inputs. This time, the scale shows it is an extensive outreach, including 174 formal consultations, across the country.

"Pioneer has taken the step in the right direction with the device, in which your smartphone is the master. Photo: Pioneer


Pioneer's new car infotainment, priced at ₹7,199, is very different from the rest for reducing driver distractions. But does it live up its to claims by relying on a voice based navigation system? Let's find out


mint-india-wire Pioneer SPH-CI9BTPioneer SPH-CI9BT reviewcar infotainmentPioneerPioneer IndiaPioneer Smart Syncdriver distractioncar accidents due to smartphone usagecar head units under 10000Pioneer SPH-CI9BT price


Since we have been conditioned to see things in a certain way, we are left scratching our heads when someone takes a radically different approach to improve a thing that isn’t broke. Take the headphone jack, for instance. When Apple announced it will be skipping one on the iPhone 7, it wasn’t received well—by critics and fans alike. But as other manufacturers caught on with this, it became slightly more acceptable.


When I got my hands on Pioneer’s newest car infotainment system, I had the same dilemma—why mess with something when it’s not even broke?


Here’s what the head unit looks like—a rather small display with four huge buttons for voice recognition, navigation, messages and calling. The volume knob and folder (up and down) buttons along with the semi-circular Music Source and Menu/App Launch buttons are pushed to the side. The bottom of the head unit has an LED-backlit parking sensor indicator.


But that’s not it, the heart of this entire system is not behind the head unit; but in your smartphone. That’s right, there’s an app called the Pioneer Smart Sync which acts as the control centre for the unit and that’s why you don’t have an EQ button or a giant screen in the middle—your phone is the centrepiece.


They have also added a really sturdy smartphone cradle with the unit which can be tilted vertically or horizontally according to your preference and when you’re not using it, you can simply tuck it inside."

"Australia railway: A railway that carries zinc from major producers such as Glencore , MMG Ltd and South 32 across Australia's Outback is expected to reopen this month after it was damaged in floods.


Column: Zinc is coming under sustained attack from bearish funds. The trigger for the assault was Tuesday morning's London Metal Exchange (LME) stocks report, showing 10,625 tonnes of inflow into exchange warehouses.


Prices: Zinc climbed 0.7% to $2,829 per tonne, lead gained 1.4% to $1,948, tin gained 0.3% to $20,434.30 while nickel added 0.8% to $13,065."

"The popularity of some unicorns is providing a kicker to the valuations of firms that own them. One such case is Info Edge (India) Ltd, which has about 26.4% stake in Zomato. In the past year, the stock has been riding piggyback on the rise in Zomato’s valuations, apart from an increase in analysts’ valuations of the company’s core business. It has run up gains of 52% in the past year, and—at ₹1,901.50 apiece—is close to a 52-week high.


Going by its latest round of funding, and the business progress, Zomato has seen a bump-up in valuations. A 2% dilution for ₹350 crore investment has raised valuations to about ₹17,500 crore ($2.6 billion). In fact, analysts are pegging Zomato’s valuation anywhere between $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion. HSBC Securities and Capital Markets Pvt. Ltd, for instance, has estimated its valuation at $3.6 billion, as against $0.9 billion on 23 July 2018. This has obviously given a fillip to the sum-of-the-parts valuation of Info Edge’s investments. Zomato is now estimated at ₹451 per share value in Info Edge’s sum-of-the-parts valuation, according to HSBC Securities.


But should investors count too much on Zomato? Sure, its business has been gaining traction. Food delivery business now accounts for about 70% of its revenues."

The South Korean conglomerate is shedding workers to streamline and refocus around future technologies, such as flexible displays.

Gandhi is following in the footsteps of his grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi, who contested and won from Karnataka’s Chikmagalur in 1978 and Medak in 1980 (to buck the anti-Emergency wave), and his mother and former party president Sonia Gandhi, who had won from Bellary in Karnataka in 1999.


With the southern states accounting for 130 out of the 543 Lok Sabha seats, it is a high-stakes contest for the Congress. In 2014, it had won only 19 seats from the south. In 2019, Congress will contest 10 seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, in alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK) and 20 in Karnataka in partnership with the Janata Dal (Secular), besides going alone in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

"Which is not to say WhatsApp is without tools to rein in the mess. This year, after the mob violence in India — another problem that existed before WhatsApp and may simply have been amplified by the app — the company instituted rules to limit WhatsApp’s “virality.""


In the past, people could freely forward a WhatsApp message to anyone. Now they are restricted to forwarding a message to 20 “chats,"" distinct conversations with an individual or group of up to 256 people. (There are six people in the average group, WhatsApp said.) In India, WhatsApp has an even more restrictive forwarding limit: five chats.


WhatsApp characterized the limits as an experiment. As the company learns more about how the limits affect users’ behavior, a spokeswoman told me, it could introduce additional fine-grain limits.


In an op-ed article in The New York Times last week, a group of Brazilian researchers called for WhatsApp to institute the Indian forwarding limit in Brazil to cut down on false news during the campaign. WhatsApp has declined to do so. The spokeswoman said there was not enough time to change before the election, which takes place Sunday. (Changing the rules would require people to update their app, a process that takes weeks.)


The company also pointed out that most discussions on WhatsApp are not viral forwards but instead are intimate conversations between individuals or small groups. “This is very different from other apps that are designed as broadcast platforms (rather like a global public square) where you can reach an audience of millions at the push of a button,"" Chris Daniels, vice president of WhatsApp, wrote in a Facebook post last week.


It is precisely WhatsApp’s close-knit sensibility that makes rumors on the service so pernicious. Familiarity on WhatsApp breeds trust, which most of the time is a pretty great social good. But in fast-moving situations with high stakes — natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks or elections — trust on WhatsApp is turned on its head, becoming a key force behind viral falsity.

"“If there is one thing Silicon Valley can learn from Chinese app development, it’s that it is tuned in to viral-as-a-service, meaning that their most popular apps have really been about making content and personas viral and also hyper-engaged,"" he said.

The app itself promises a video-sharing community that’s “raw, real and without boundaries"" and claims to be appropriate for children aged 12 and older.


Parents aren’t always convinced, given the numbers of young girls suggestively singing along to sexually explicit lyrics which are often degrading to women.


Such videos are the stock in trade of Halia Beamer, an American 13-year-old who has emerged as one of TikTok’s stars, chalking up more than five million followers.


Media reports have documented cases of users being bombarded with disturbing comments, while others have been asked for private contact details or to post provocative images.


Last summer the Indonesian government banned the app after more than 170,000 people signed a petition saying that lip-syncing in revealing outfits was not suitable for children.


It was lifted only after TikTok representatives from China flew to Jakarta and promised to hire more people to weed out inappropriate content."

"The venue itself indicates the importance of the event to Apple. The company has only used the Steve Jobs Theater at its new headquarters twice since it opened two years ago. The first time, Apple debuted the iPhone X. The second time, it launched the iPhone XS and latest Apple Watch. To ensure all attention will be on services, Apple took the rare step of announcing several new hardware products on its website last week, including upgraded AirPods, iPads, and iMacs.


Unlike the iPhone in 2007, which broke new ground, Apple’s video service faces stiff competition from well-established players. Netflix, Amazon, Walt Disney Co., Hulu, and AT&T Inc. are investing at least $20 billion combined each year on content, while Apple is spending about $1 billion this year, according to Ives. He thinks Apple needs to acquire a major video content company, although the iPhone maker has shunned big deals in the past.


Still, there’s a base of at least 1.4 billion active Apple devices, giving the company an advantage over rivals such as Netflix. The Apple video service will be tied to a TV app that is already pre-installed on Apple devices, putting the company’s content at the fingertips of hundreds of millions of potential viewers.


Apple Music and Apple’s App Store have already benefited from being standard features of iPhones and other gadgets made by the company. Services revenue reached almost $11 billion in the holiday quarter, up 19% from a year earlier.


'If Apple executes with minimal speed bumps and aggressively acquires content, given the company’s massive installed base and unmatched brand loyalty we believe reaching 100 million subscriptions in the medium term (3 to 5 years) is a realistic goal that could translate into a $7 billion to $10 billion annual revenue stream over time,' Ives wrote in a recent note to investors.


Apple is also working on a premium games subscription for its App Store and discussing it with potential partners, according to people with knowledge of the plans. This service won’t take on new cloud-based streaming offerings like Google Stadia. Instead, it will focus on iPhones and iPads and bundle together paid games from different developers that consumers can access for a monthly fee. Cheddar previously reported that Apple was working on a gaming-related subscription service.


The company would collect these monthly fees, then divide up the revenue between developers based on how much time users spend playing their games, one of the people said. Apple is likely considering popular paid titles on the App Store and would exclude titles that are free to download but generate revenue via in-app purchases.


Apple could discuss the service as soon as Monday, or it may choose to detail the offering at its conference for developers later this year. Some of the most popular paid games on the App Store include Microsoft-owned Minecraft and franchises like NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto."

"In the supply chain for electronics, contract manufacturers buy Qualcomm chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined their defense.


The contract manufacturers have since filed claims of their own against Qualcomm, alleging the San Diego company’s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty payment constitutes an anticompetitive business practice.


They are seeking $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm for royalties they allege were illegal. That figure could triple if the manufacturers succeed on their antitrust claims.


Ted Boutrous, a high-profile partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who is representing the contract manufacturers, told Reuters that statements from Qualcomm executives suggesting there were meaningful settlement talks with the contract manufacturers were “false."""

“For it to have an impact, it has to develop a larger narrative around corruption or national security. But a fight against corruption wouldn’t auger well for the Congress, given the perception around its own party,"" said Sarma.


However, he said there was more ammunition that the Congress could use against the Modi government, such as intolerance, lack of jobs, weak foreign policy and regional instability, besides peddling fake narratives and failures in the Kashmir policy, among others.


“Purely from a campaign perspective, I believe Congress should counter aggression with aggression. They need to infuse more energy and get into a frontal attack mode, to somewhat swing the anti-incumbency factor in their favour. But they are a very distant second at this point. Strategising like the Congress won’t help them in these elections. They need help to think and act like the BJP, to counter BJP."""

"Irrespective of whether they support the opposition alliance, voters in Gopalganj, Prasad’s birth place, and Saran, which he represented in Parliament for five terms, say they sorely miss Prasad’s energy. “For good or for bad, he came to symbolize Bihar. My family has never voted for his party, but he was an important contrarian voice,"" said Munna Singh, a driver from Mehian village.


Born in Phulwaria in a poor peasant family, Prasad is infamous for having overseen a regime that was described as “jungle raj"" due to the abysmal law and order situation that prevailed. He was accused of corruption and participating in benami land deals.


“Lalu arrived on the political scene in Bihar at a time when the average upper caste voter did not want to see a Yadav as chief minister. He understood this sentiment early on and used it to his benefit,"" said Rakesh Ranjan, who teaches political science at Patna College and is a state coordinator for the Lokniti programme of New Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies . “He had a massive opportunity to be remembered as a political hero but two things brought him down—the fodder scam and nepotism, which began when he made his wife Rabri Devi chief minister.""


In the 2015 assembly elections, Prasad led the alliance that blocked the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) entry in Bihar. The current Lok Sabha polls are critical to the opposition alliance as former ally and now chief minister Nitish Kumar switched sides to join the National Democratic Alliance. This election will be a key indicator of whether the opposition alliance can pull off a win without Kumar and whether the RJD can be a potent force without the physical presence of Prasad.


Bihar has always been split on whether Prasad is the “messiah of the backwards"" or the architect of the state’s downfall, and these sentiments have sharpened in his absence. “He pushed Bihar back by decades. We still see the effect his policies had on education and employment. Now the same legacy is being passed on to his sons,"" said Shashi Gupta, a salesman at an electronic shop in Thawe near Gopalganj.


A challenge lies ahead of the RJD, which was down to just two Lok Sabha seats in 2014. This time, it is part of the coalition of Congress and smaller regional parties against the BJP-led alliance, which includes Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJSP).


RJD was a steady ally of the Congress, and Prasad’s loyalty to former party president Sonia Gandhi is well-known. “Even before Congress leaders started talking about Gandhi as a prime ministerial candidate in the early 2000s, Prasad publicly endorsed her for the post. RJD continues to be our biggest ally, but that bond between the RJD and Congress is missing now and it is felt on the ground,"" a senior state Congress leader said.


Voters feel the alliance lacks a common narrative. Congress president Rahul Gandhi and RJD’s lead campaigner and former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav have held just one joint rally in four phases of polling so far."

"KOLKATA: In West Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to win at least half the seats, says the party’s state president and Medinipur candidate Dilip Ghosh. Tackling corruption and implementing National Register of Citizens are on the party’s agenda if it wins, he said in an interview.


Restoration of democracy is the main agenda of this election. The one-point programme of the BJP is to protect democracy because there is no democracy in West Bengal. In the panchayat elections last year, people could not file nominations for over a third of the seats. Trinamool Congress members surrounded the office where nominations were to be filed for seven days. There was large-scale violence during panchayat elections. In 20,100 of 58,000 panchayat seats, nobody could file a nomination; over 42% of rural voters were unable to cast their votes. This is the situation in West Bengal. The second big issue is corruption and political violence. At least 42 BJP workers were killed and over 100 political killings have happened across the state. The police force is not allowed to investigate these cases. Yet, BJP won 7,000 seats in the panchayat election even after so much violence.


Political violence is the strategy of Communists. Wherever Communists have been in power, whether in India or other countries, they have used political violence. So we see political violence in West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala. This has become a culture in Bengal. The party that rules the state takes control of the police and state administration and makes it powerless. Even police personnel are beaten up in Bengal. People are threatened. Change should happen in Bengal as it did in Tripura."

WAYANAD: Thushar Vellappally was grinning from ear to ear when he filed his nomination in Wayanad on Wednesday as a Bharatiya Janata Party-backed National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate for the general election. He has landed up with the biggest break a political novice can think of— a contest against a probable prime ministerial candidate, Congress president Rahul Gandhi.


His own party members do not fancy a chance to win. The seat is a traditional Congress turf. The total votes polled by the BJP in the previous polls in 2014 was about 80,000— which is at best a spoiler between the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front, the other two main fronts contesting in Wayanad."

"In initial investigations, Samsung engineers determined that removing the top layer of film — something they hadn’t anticipated users would do — damaged the product, people familiar with the matter said.

Some of this optimism was seen in the December quarter results. A ramp-up in exports helped PI Industries clock 32% revenue growth. UPL reported 17% growth, largely boosted by growth in Latin America. Comparatively, Rallis India clocked 6.9% growth, while Dhanuka’s revenues fell by about 2.5%."
"The Redmi Note 7's notch is reminiscent of the Essential Phone's while the Samsung Galaxy M20 takes the more contemporary approach of a teardrop notch with its Infinity-V display.


The Galaxy M20 starts at ₹10,990 for the 3GB/32GB variant. The Redmi Note 7 hasn't been launched in India, but it starts at 999 Yuan (about ₹ 10,000) 


Samsung's latest entry in the Indian smartphone is the Galaxy M20, which is targeted at the so-called budget and image conscious millennials. The M20 comes with several features that weren't found in Samsung smartphones of the same price until now, but are standard among other Chinese smartphones. This includes fingerprint scanning, facial recognition and a notched display. With Xiaomi closing up in its rearview mirrors in terms of market share, the M-series is very important to Samsung. The volume segment is a major area of opportunity to widen its gap to the Chinese giant.


Then we have the Redmi Note 7, which is the torch bearer of the beloved Note series by the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi. The Note 6 Pro (The only Note 6-series smartphone launched in November 2018 in India) failed to be as popular as its predecessor, the Note 5 Pro. This along with the woes of dying smartphone sales throughout the makes it a crucial smartphone for Xiaomi."

The Huawei Y9 will most likely be a companion to the Nova 3i which has been taking on mid-range smartphones on its own. We can expect the Y9 to be pitted strongly against the Redmi Note 6 Pro, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 and the Honor 8X.


The Y9 was launched as the Huawei Enjoy 9 Plus in China which is lit up by a 6.5-inch LCD display with a resolution of 2340x1080. It is powered by the octa-core Kirin 710 SoC paired with Mali-G51 MP4 GPU. The chipset is mated with either 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage or 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage."
"May Day used to be the day for the working class to gather strength and consolidate, and the organized Left would act as its facilitator. Haven’t the dynamics changed now?


There is greater discontent and greater distraught among the working class today. And May Day as a day of expression of solidarity for the working class has actually been submerged under the struggles of day-to-day existence. In that sense, it is probably one of the worst periods that the Indian working class is going through today. Unemployment has surged; quality of life has fallen drastically.


The party is still the vanguard of the working class. We will not only support but also facilitate and encourage the position of the working class through solidarity. Whatever be the unions they belong to, we want the workers to come together for their rights and so create a better country and economy.


In January, you had the two-day industrial strike all over the country. Over five to six crore workers participated in the strike that was called under the Left initiative. And you had the worker-peasant rally in Delhi, which was unprecedented by any measure, recently. It is through these struggles that we are reminding of the Left’s relevance. In every single instance of public sector privatization, the unions and the struggles that are being done, they are all being spearheaded by the Left."

""From a technical point of view, there is a first support level (for gold) at $1,266, while the previous support levels of $1,280 and 1,288 now represent a resistance area for prices,"" ActiveTrades chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa said in a note from Thursday."

"Dubai: Bond investors rattled by Bahrain’s fiscal woes last year are bracing for the next potential crisis in the Gulf region: Oman.


The cash-strapped sultanate has been slow to implement reforms following the crash in oil prices in 2014 and is seeking to tap the debt market for a fourth year. Its budget deficit is among the largest of all the sovereigns tracked by Fitch Ratings, which downgraded its debt to junk in December. Concerns over Oman’s dwindling buffers have also sparked a debate on whether it’ll need a bailout similar to the one that Bahrain got last year.


“Oman has the most concerning credit trends in the region,"" said Abdul Kadir Hussain, the head of fixed income at Arqaam Capital, a Dubai-based investment bank. “Issuance needs are high.""


Oman’s bonds are cheap relative Gulf Cooperation Council peers. At around 7 percent, the sultanate’s 2028 bond yields about 40 basis points more than Bahrain’s debt of similar maturity -- even though Oman is rated two levels higher at BB by Fitch."

"CVoter, which has run a daily opinion poll since January, said Congress support in Uttar Pradesh has dropped off after jumping 10 percentage points in the days following the news that Vadra had taken a party post.


Late in March, about 8.9% of state voters backed the Congress, a far cry from the 43.4% supporting the BJP and the 44% behind an alliance of two major regional parties.


However, even with Vadra's hectic campaigning, Congress is struggling to get its message of welfare to voters, party officials said.


Six voters in Uttar Pradesh said they had not heard of Congress's NYAY scheme to give India's poorest families monthly handouts of ₹6,000.


""They brought her in at a very wrong time,"" said one Congress official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak formally to media.


A better time would have been December, just days after Congress won power in three key states, giving her more time to prepare, he added. Others in the party have said it should have been years earlier.


The BJP has dismissed Vadra's formal entry into politics as inconsequential and Modi said it only showed that for some ""the family is the party"".


But Congress will seize on momentum building against the BJP, said Kamal Nath, a top Congress leader and chief minister of Madhya Pradesh."

OnePlus is expected to launch its next flagship handset in May, which might be powered by the Snapdragon 855 chipset. It might also have a 5G variant running Qualcomm's X55 modem. Reports also suggest that it would carry a camera module that might be a significant step up from the existing setup."

India needs more competitiveness in exports and it is unlikely to be achieved by just a depreciating currency

"West Bengal has the second largest number of MSME units in the country, with an estimated 8.86 million units accounting for 14% of the national share


All of Bengal’s conundrums are in evidence in this surcharged polls. Will the result end up being predictable?


The BJP is using verbal, non-physical grammar to also stretch Mamata Banerjee’s political smarts to the limit. Nothing is beyond the pale of possible


Kolkata/Asansol: In a constituency in south Bengal, this reporter met a Trinamool Congress (TMC) worker. Over tea at a roadside stall, the man, who is pretty low in the TMC organizational hierarchy, confessed that he was actually a volunteer for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) non-political parent. He, and some of his other fellow travellers, had decided to campaign for the TMC to ward off the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM.


Former British prime minister Winston Churchill’s observation about Russia—a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma—is freely used to describe India. If that be so, then West Bengal is a conundrum, an amalgam of contradictions.


Nothing brings out the contrasts sharper than in election time. The general elections to the 17th Lok Sabha have converted Bengal into a battleground state: with 42 seats up for grabs, pitched battles are being fought, personal insults traded on a daily basis and display of money and muscle power thrust in your face. Gopal Krishna Gokhale’s famous pre-Independence quote about the state—what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow—is perhaps primed for a tweak.


The 2014 round of elections saw the TMC surge ahead with 34 seats, the Congress bagging four seats and the balance four being divided equally between the BJP and the CPM.


For a state that had voted decisively for the CPM for over three decades, the cast of characters has changed overnight: it is now a battle between the TMC and the BJP, with the Congress and the CPM being reduced to side players. The CPM’s slide is illustrative of the shift in voter preferences: from 176 seats in 2007 state assembly elections to 40 in 2011 to 26 in 2016.


The battle lines in the current elections got drawn as soon as it became clear that the Narendra Modi-led BJP was unlikely to reprise its 2014 act , in which it had single-handedly won 282 seats. The portents were evident when the Congress managed to wrest three battleground states—Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh—during the 2018 winter assembly elections.


In Uttar Pradesh, two long-time political rivals with claims on a favourable caste arithmetic—the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party—have joined hands to take on the BJP’s electoral machinery and reclaim some seats from its 71-seat haul last time."
"“Indiabulls Housing Finance gets access to banking platform, essentially the liability franchisee and provides longevity to its lending business on a consistent basis.
