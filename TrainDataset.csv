"The roadshow and the filing of nomination papers are also an attempt to show the strength of the ruling BJP in the eastern UP region, as several ministers and allies of the party are in Varanasi for the filing of nomination, expected on Friday.


BJP won 17 of the 18 Lok Sabha seats in the region in 2014, losing only Azamgarh to Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. It repeated the performance in the 2017 assembly polls, when it returned to power in Uttar Pradesh after a gap of 15 years.


BJP leaders said Modi visits Varanasi every few months and meets its residents. In the last five years, he had been to Varanasi at least 30 times, they said.


Finance minister Arun Jaitley tweeted that Modi’s roadshow that culminated with the customary Ganga aarti, “expresses only one indication""—that the PM “is well on the way of repeating or even increasing the 2014 victory margin"".",0
"These vulnerabilities could have allowed hackers to access sensitive information and take control over a number of smart home devices on the platform like door locks, security cameras and thermostats


NEW DELHI: In September 2016, a major part of the internet on the east coast of the US went on the blink following the biggest cyber attack in the history of the internet. Now we know that it was the Mirai malware that triggered this internet of things (IoT) botnet attack that took down big websites including Twitter, The Guardian, Netflix, Reddit, and CNN. Two years later in July, Cisco Talos found several vulnerabilities in the firmware of Samsung’s SmartThings Hub platform for its IOT devices.


These vulnerabilities could have allowed hackers to access sensitive information and take control over a number of smart home devices on the platform like door locks, security cameras and thermostats. These devices can be found on Shodan, a search engine for IoT devices and then using Nmap scan hackers can identify the ones with open ports whose IP address is visible online.",1

Digital platforms are on a high growth path, according to the FICCI-EY media and entertainment report. Subscription growth has begun and advertising rates are already at levels much higher than those charged by traditional media. Programmatic advertising could further impact advertising revenue yield. The report, however, cautioned that success will depend on massive growth in reach and more paying subscribers.


For Bhalla, both will continue to grow in the short to medium term. “India is content starved. We have a single screen per household in 95% plus households. The personal OTT screen will increase consumption overall. In the data we have seen connected sub consume 1.5X the media vs their unconnected counterparts,"" Bhalla said.


“TV viewing is part of communal viewing in India. It is in that sense a living room product where you consume and discuss content with your family. A digital platform is a bedroom product that is mobile for your own personal consumption,"" according to Ashish Pherwani, partner and head (advisory, media and entertainment) EY. He adds that, while formats can change, devices to consume content can change, the two basic tenets on which TV thrives—knowledge and escapism will continue to drive the future.

"Voters in Uttarakhand believe that Modi and his government have done more for rejuvenating the Ganga than the Congress. (Pradeep Gaur/Mint)


DEVPRAYAG/RISHIKESH/HARIDWAR: Voters along the banks of the Ganga, which begins its journey in Uttarakhand, feel that while the Union government’s aim of rejuvenating the river is still a distant goal, the political credibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is high and their ‘faith’ in his promise of working for the river continues.


In Uttarakhand, the Ganga is the supreme embodiment and repository of faith. The hill state is home to Char Dham, Rishikesh and Haridwar, some of the holiest of Hindu shrines and pilgrim destinations and thus rejuvenating the river is a major issue here.


Voters, however, feel that the Ganga in itself does not shape up as an electoral plank and is instead linked with the overall issue of development in the hill state.

"While Patnaik continues to be a popular leader, he is facing a stiff competition from the BJP. “People have always voted for BJD candidates in the name of Naveen Patnaik.

In a way, in 2019, Odisha is observing a fight between a suave regional strongman against a national strongman who is growing stronger as an administrator post the surgical strikes in Balakot,"" said Amareswar Mishra, a political analyst and retired professor of Utkal University.


BJP leader and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who has been consistently working in the state almost concurs. “Three things helping BJP in the state are PM Modi, anti-incumbency due to 19 years of misrule by CM Naveen Patnaik, and the growth in BJP’s organizational capacity in the last five years,"" Pradhan said asserting that the BJP will stage an upset in the state.

"On the other hands, for indigenous people—Wayanad district is home to the largest concentration of tribals in Kerala, at 18.55%— the houses are still crude; many of them made of clay and wild cane. People walk barefoot. This is the least populated district in Kerala, but there are hardly enough schools, colleges, medical dispensaries or even water and electricity in some pockets.


Not just the tribals, the outsiders or the early cultivators who later settled in Wayanad and form the majority of the population now, are equally upset over the bad performance of the district. The floods in 2018 ravaged the existing roads, houses and farm lands, some of which are yet to regain into its original shape. Last decade, a crisis of falling prices and glut in the market gripped the small land holding farmers who work the soil of Wayanad, considered as one of the most fertile; hundreds died of debt and starvation. It is how Pulpally in Wayanad came to be known as Kerala’s Vidarbha. The crisis forced many to move out of farming, but its shadows still loom large. Only five days ago, a farmer killed himself in Thirunelli in Wayanad owing to over ₹7 lakh in debts taken for both farm and personal use.


Wayanad’s rolling hills are also known for making some of the best of south Indian coffee, and is one of the main employment opportunities (apart from tourism jobs, small business and rural employment guarantee scheme). But in the large landed estates, biggest of them run by corporates such as Harrison Malayalam, the workers receive very small percentage of the profits.

Though a mineral-rich state, Jharkhand’s economic fortunes have often been unpredictable. That is because monsoon and global metals and mineral prices impact both the economic activity in the state as well as the state’s revenue stream from royalty payments by producers. After a stellar growth rate of 11.2% in real gross state domestic product in FY17, Jharkhand’s growth has moderated in the subsequent two years—6.7% in FY18 and an estimated 6.8% in FY19, as per figures available with the state government, which has brought developmental issues including jobs back in focus.


While BJP hopes its welfare measures including those on distribution of LPG connections without upfront charges, rural electrification, and health insurance will pay electoral dividends, the state still has a long way to go in improving the living standards of people.

"While it is true that organized criminals are increasingly devising new techniques, most attacks— including those at the largest corporations—are relatively unsophisticated.

Most companies do not have a comprehensive crisis-response strategy. For instance, an EY-led cyberattack simulation exercise with 79 leading CEOs revealed that many were unsure about how to handle ransom demands from cybercriminals. The most proactive companies conduct periodic “war-games"" with the board and top management to ensure that their crisis-response plans are exhaustive and robust.

"The BJP leadership believes that the PM-Kisan scheme will help double farmers’ incomes by 2022, while the Congress plan also acknowledges the need for income support for the poorest.


According to the BJP’s plan, at least 120 million farmers with less than 5 acres of land are expected to get at least ₹6,000 annually. The money will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of farmers in three tranches—the first instalment of ₹2,000 has already been sent to around 20 million farmers. The project will cost at least ₹75,000 crore annually and the figure is likely to increase in the coming years. The Congress’s mega plan, on the other hand, is expected to benefit at least 50 million families, or 250 million people. The money will be given directly to beneficiaries.

“Farmers and rural distress are going to be a major talking point in the elections. The Union government has tried to reform agriculture in the country through soil health cards, insurance scheme and now PM Kisan programme. It was under this government that MSP was increased to 1.5 times and the government is working on the idea of doubling farm income by 2022,"" said a senior BJP leader from Lucknow.


Consequently, the new scheme was Modi’s counter to the pan-India loan waiver promised by Congress president Rahul Gandhi. In particular, the loan waiver promise helped Congress to defeat BJP in key state elections in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in December.


According to the government, the PM-Kisan scheme will help 120 million farmer families live with respect, besides helping pay for cultivation and reducing debts. The PM-Kisan scheme is expected to cost ₹20,000 crore in 2018-19, and ₹75,000 crore in 2019-20 and will cover 86% of all farm households.


PM-Kisan signals an alternative approach to supporting farmers, moving away from price support interventions. In the recent past, several states have launched their own farm income support schemes—for instance, ₹8,000 per acre per year in Telangana and ₹10,000 per farmer family per year in Odisha.


PM-Kisan also holds a special relevance for Uttar Pradesh given the number of small and marginal farmers in India’s most populous state, where the BJP will be fighting a Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party combine. The state sends the largest number of MPs to Parliament.",0
"Facebook Inc. unveiled a redesign that focuses on the Groups feature of its main social network, doubling down on a successful but controversial part of its namesake app and another sign that Facebook is moving toward more private, intimate communication. (Bloomberg)


A new feature called ""Secret Crush"" will let people signal which friends they are interested in romantically on a private crush list


Got a crush on another Facebook user? The social network will help you connect, as part of a revamp unveiled Tuesday that aims to foster real-world relationships and make the platform a more intimate place for groups of friends.


The new features were introduced in a revamped Facebook app as the embattled social network embarks on a new strategy emphasizing private communications and small groups.


""As the world gets bigger and more connected, we need that sense of intimacy more than ever,"" Mark Zuckerberg said as he opened the F8 developer conference for the social networking giant.


The new app made available to US users Tuesday aims for a new direction for Facebook: it eliminates the blue background and offers a range of new ways to connect, in line with Zuckerberg's vision to move away from the ""digital town square"" to a ""digital living room.""

"Natural language processing (NLP), of which NLU is a subset, is difficult because the tasks regarding linguistics need to include variations in human psychology, cultures and linguistic diversities. Further, most conversational experiences today are either very broad but shallow (for example, “What’s the time?"" = “The time is 10.00 am"") or very narrow but deep (for example, a multi-turn conversation in a quiz game).


To advance beyond these limited experiences, we will need to get to a world of both wide and deep conversations. This will require the machine’s ability to scale beyond the current technical limitations of recognizing between only a few hundred intents at a time. Another limitation of machine conversations is personalization. In a natural conversation between two people, each will normally draw on previous experiences with the other person and tailor the responses accordingly. Computer conversations that don’t do this tend to feel unnatural and even annoying. Addressing this in the long term will require solving challenges such as speaker identification, so that the computer knows who you are and can respond differently to you versus someone else.


Many enterprises and conversational AI solution developers, in the last couple of years, have been busy developing chatbots of primarily two kinds. The first is enterprise chatbots that are built to solve enterprise use cases such as customer support, lead generation, etc. The second category is direct-to-consumer bots—chatbots that reach the consumer directly for specific applications. However, most enterprise bots currently available are automated versions of FAQs (frequently asked questions) and are unable to hold conversations beyond a few interactive dialogues.


Consumer interest will materialize when machine intelligence gets near human intelligence. Having said that, the diversity, scale and capabilities available in the Indian market could be leveraged to make an early mark.",1

"Already, work is fissuring. The trend towards outsourcing has already gained momentum over the past decades affecting support functions like accounting and human resources, and manual activities like facilities management and security. As businesses become more and more focused on core competencies, they will shed activities closer and closer to the core. The rapid rise of digital “on-demand"" or “sharing economy"" work platforms in the US, such as TaskRabbit, Upwork, Freelancer.com, is testament to what we will see in India.


In a significant uptick, independent work will become more organized, more decent. The future of work may not hold full-time contractual jobs for all Indians, but it holds the promise of more gainful and decent work for many independent workers—delivery persons, cab drivers, self-employed snack food makers, contractual cleaners, to name just a few. These workers typically have a high degree of autonomy—they decide how much they work, and are paid for the tasks they perform or the output they produce rather than receiving fixed salaries against secure job contracts. As they become part of more organized, digitized value chains, independent workers will adopt systems that keep track of the work they do, use productivity tools, get training opportunities, and sometimes even benefits like subsidized healthcare or life insurance. A bathroom cleaner now has the chance to be a facilities manager of a franchise business (public toilets, in this case), with the discipline and formalization that comes from being part of an organized business.


Besides, a very positive outcome of such transformations would be that workplaces will become more diverse. Women hold just 25% of entry-level jobs in Indian firms compared to 45-50% in the Asia-Pacific region, by our survey, and shockingly only 4% of senior management jobs, compared to 11-13% in Indonesia and China, and up to 25 to 33% in Singapore and the Philippines. This could change, and quickly. More Indian women want to stay in work through life stages like marriage and maternity. Multinational companies and global value chains are influencing local firms to promote diversity. The demand for skills, like collaboration and teamwork, will make it imperative to recruit from diverse talent pools and normalize “flex"" at work. The future of work in India may look decidedly female.


Finally, as India’s labour force grows by 138 million people by 2030, it will be challenging to prepare new entrants for quality jobs of the future that require higher skills. Many of India’s schools, higher educational institutions, and skilling ecosystems are not geared up to this challenge. Much greater collaboration between the public and private sectors will be critical to bridge the gulf between what is taught in classrooms and what employers expect. Students will need early exposure to problem-solving, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), and data sciences to adjust to a data-driven and experimentation-oriented world. Countries like Estonia and the UK have introduced coding classes as early as age five or seven, in response to this. And alongside this, we will also need to focus on building soft skills, like communication and teamwork, important for the “new collar"" jobs of the future.


In India, as around the world, there is no time to lose. We need creative visions to prepare for a world where the meaning of work is shifting rapidly—and the skills in demand rising exponentially. The risk we must prepare for is not just the dearth of jobs, but more likely the scarcity of skills that the future of work will demand.",1

"Now, the amount of voltage is determined by how fast the magnet moves, which in-turn determines how much current will flow across the loop (since voltage is directly proportional to the current in the circuit.


Let’s replace this magnet with an “electromagnet"" or a copper coil with electricity flowing through it. The current flowing through the coil will in create a magnetic field (more precisely electromagnetic flux) and hence do the same thing you did by moving the magnet. Since this induces current in the copper loop, this can be called inductor.


Making an analogy with the real life scenario, a charging mat takes the role of the inductor (you can also call it the transmitter) while the setup on your smartphone can be called the receiver.


This is an oversimplified explanation—wireless charging is way more complicated than that, since it involves a lot of miniaturisation. You would remember from school days how big an electromagnet can get even if you created one with simple copper wires.


Extending this setup to a larger set of wirelessly charging devices poses another issue—different devices have different voltage requirements. So setting a universal standard is important, just like how all wall sockets in India have more or less the same kind of design.",1

Some banks have long had accounts aimed at children and teenagers, and many families use prepaid debit cards rather than traditional debit cards, linked to a checking account as a way to help children manage money


Jonathan and Erin Kraftchick started out by paying their two children’s allowance the old-fashioned way, using paper money.

So when Jonathan Kraftchick read about a “smart"" debit card called goHenry this year, he quickly signed the family up for an account.


Now, the children — Reece, 8, and Caris, 7 — each have a card, which their parents manage using an app on their phones. They have $1 for each year of age, per week, automatically transferred each week to the cards, which the children can use to buy items like snacks at their neighborhood swimming pool.

"“During the rule of the Congress a perception was deliberately created that all problems of the people were because of traders. The Congress tried to protect hoarders by blaming traders for price rise and corruption,"" Modi said at a public meeting with traders in Delhi.

The dream of New India cannot be realized without the help of traders who are the biggest stakeholders in the development process of the country, he said. “The trading community employs 30-40 crore people. Traders are the biggest stakeholders. We cannot complete the dream of building New India without traders,"" he added.

"Supporters of the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) hold placards with the images of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (R) and BJP president Amit Shah (C) at a rally. (AFP )


In the 2014 general elections, the biggest surprise, even more than the audacious win posted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the verdict in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP won 73 (including two seats won by its allies) of the total 80 seats from the state, establishing its electoral dominance in no uncertain terms. It no doubt cemented the final verdict with the BJP winning a majority of its own with 282 seats.


Fast forward to this year’s general election and the big question is whether the saffron surprise this time around will be in the two eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha. If indeed this does transpire, as anecdotal evidence and ground reporting by Mint’s reporters suggest, then this performance will be equally important—though unlikely to match the scale—to what transpired in Uttar Pradesh in the 16th general election.


To be sure, one is not forecasting any outcome, just flagging the fact that this general election may establish unprecedented trend lines in the two states of Odisha and West Bengal, stemming from the pole position that the BJP has now come to occupy in national politics. And this would define the contours of the future national electoral discourse, especially if this contest turns out to be a semi-final.",0

"The tech companies today treat data as capital, which comes to them at no cost. Think of a company that is building nursing robots, which could become a reality sooner than we think. To create these robots, the company will collect huge amounts of data on how efficiently human nurses go about their work. The irony is that these robots will ultimately replace these nurses and take away their livelihoods because now they have ingested and been programmed with all the data these humans have generated—for free.


Or consider the Google translation software. It constantly searches the internet for translation work being carried out in the public sphere; captures that data; and the algorithms use that data to produce more accurate results.


Facebook pays only 1% of its value to its programmers, the rest of its work it gets free from us. Walmart pays 40% of its value in wages-


Languages are living entities, changing over time, with new words, expressions, idioms and slangs being added ever so often. Google is constantly monitoring all this activity and making its translation function more and more precise. There may come a day when professional translators will be put out of business by Google, which has developed its expertise by gorging—without any cost—on all the data that these people have been generating. Should not the translators have been paid?


Throughout human history, profession after profession has become obsolete due to technological progress. But usually, this has meant people upgrading their skills and getting better-paying jobs. When horse carriages were replaced by automobiles, carriage drivers became car drivers. In the print media, when the job of the cut-paste artist became defunct, he quickly learnt page-making software. But in the coming revolution, all of us can hardly become AI programmers. There will be massive job losses and possibly social unrest.


Users are generally unaware of the riches that they are creating for the tech titans through their online interactions. But there is a massive transfer of wealth taking place in our economies that may lead to a disturbingly inegalitarian future.


In the early days of the growth of the internet, when the idealists were in charge, there came to be some sort of a consensus that the internet would be a medium for free exchange of information and ideas. So how would the firms make money?


Entrepreneurs turned to the advertising model. And advertising needed targeting of consumers. The result was that a few clever people built what Lanier calls “siren servers"", gigantic computational facilities that could out-compute anything else on earth. This led to enormous user bases which used the services for free in exchange for their data. These firms became monopsonies (a market situation in which buyers are few and sellers are many) whose interests, by definitions, lie in keeping prices low—in this case, the price of data, on which they could build their empires.",1

"Pollution along the coast has depleted schools of fish, and fishermen have to go deeper into the ocean for a good catch.


Overfishing, resulting from the increased number of boats, also forces some fishermen to risk their lives to take their diesel-powered boats deeper into the ocean than they should for a better catch. Finally, greed is another reason that has only increased the number of arrests of Indian fishermen. The Indus, coming from Pakistan, empties into the Arabian Sea, forming Sir Creek, an estuary rich in fish, and one of many contested boundaries between India and Pakistan. Fishermen often get caught along this 100-km marshland as most boats don’t have a GPS system or the men are not trained to use it.


Out on the high seas, the men find themselves in an obstacle course of jagged tackles and heavy stacks of 500-kg fishing nets as their boats seesaw in gale-force winds. Most fishermen are away for up to 16 days at a stretch with a limited supply of drinking water.


Upon their return, their catch is sold to some of the large fish processing firms, which makes payments to these fishermen only after 60 days or 90 days. This ‘work now, pay later’ system means most fishermen are forced to borrow and are easy prey for the local loan sharks.",0

In Bengaluru, very strikingly different localities with very different problems come under the same constituency, that could become a disincentive for voters who may not see a benefit of voting itself as it may not connect with hyper-local problems or demands. Low voter turnout is often read as a sign of pro-incumbency.

New Delhi:While the announcement by the Congress that party president Rahul Gandhi will fight from a second seat—the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency in northern Kerala—is proving to be a political potboiler with both the Left and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacking the Gandhi scion, the socio-economic context of the chosen constituency is no less fascinating.

What happens at the ration shop is a bigger concern than what happens at the border, which is a mere 15 km from Tanot village, where he lives now


Despite the lukewarm traction for a strident anti-Pakistan viewpoint in these parts, the BJP campaign in Jaisalmer-Barmer has relied heavily on it


One of Satram Ram’s earliest memories is running away from Pakistani bombs as a 12-year-old. One morning in November 1965, a few men came to Kishangarh, a border village on Rajasthan’s protruding western edge in Jaisalmer district, and asked everyone to run. Ram took off with his mother and sister to the nearest major town, Ramgarh, with “enough rations to last just two days"". Yet, for 65-year-old Ram, nationalism hardly matters in the upcoming polls.


What happens at the ration shop is a bigger concern than what happens at the border, which is a mere 15 km from Tanot village, where he lives now. The “fingerprint machine"" (Aadhaar-enabled PDS) won’t give his ration on some days. And, he has to physically go collect it himself, while he could give his ration card to a younger person earlier. “There is no use for the poor if Modi comes back to power,"" Ram says.",0

"CPUs for desktops are designed for faster performance and overclocking to boost performance in graphic- intensive scenarios), while the mobile version for laptops are meant for comparably lower performance, to keep heating in check and provide more battery backup. For instance, Intel’s Core i7 for desktops come with up to eight cores, 12MB cache and can muster higher clock speed of up to 5GHz, while the mobile version will have up to four cores, 8MB cache and clock speeds of up to 4.5GHz.


The icing on the cake is the flexibility to upgrade, which until now had only been available in desktops. So if something more powerful arrives a year down the line, users can swap it with Intel core i9 CPU running in Alienware Area-51m. This is good news for users as they won’t have to buy a new PC when they wish to upgrade a year down the line. However, upgrading the GPU is not going to be as simple, since it reportedly uses Dell’s proprietary slot, called DGFF (Dell graphics form-factor) for GPUs. This means any GPU upgrades in future will have to support the new slot too. So there is a possibility that users may have to go back to Dell for all future GPU upgrades, points out Aayush Bhardwaj, a professional gamer.

Second is what goes to the future—sometimes value comes at a cost and that is where the brand differentiation comes in.

"By global standards, India’s female political participation lags behind major democracies including its neighbours. Around 13% of all elected representatives in the Lok Sabha in India are women. According to data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the global average for women in the lower house of parliament is 18%. Both Pakistan (20%) and Bangladesh (21%) also have more women in the lower house of the parliament than India.


A feature of female political participation is that women are more likely to be fielded from constituencies reserved for the scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs). In 2014, 24% of all 670 women candidates were fielded from SC/ST seats. This figure has increased over time. This could be because reserved seats are seen as less competitive and present an easy starting point for women candidates, according to political scientist Francesca Jensenius . Data on elected women MPs suggests that this could be true. The proportion of women MPs elected from reserved constituencies is higher than those elected from general constituencies.


While the regional parties have challenged national parties to follow their lead and nominate more women candidates to the elections, our analysis reveals that leading national parties already field a higher proportion of women candidates than most regional parties.",0

"Increasing the inclusion factor for China’s A-shares would lead to a recalibration of the MSCI indices in three stages. As a result, weights of many emerging markets will come down. The worst hit will be South Korea and Taiwan, as their weights would sharply decline. India, too, will feel the heat, with its weight in the MSCI EM index estimated to decline by 50 basis points to 8.3% by November.


“The world is moving to passive index investing.

"New Delhi: If you grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, you will probably remember video games like Street Fighter II, Mario and Pac-Man. One of the earliest first-person shooters (FPS), Wolfenstein, also belongs to this era. These games, which are the basis for many of today’s cinematic and advanced games, are making a strong comeback.


And, it is smartphones that have revived casual gaming in a big way. Games like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, Alto’s Odyssey and others are commonly seen as a way to spend time while commuting. Other classics, including Bandai Namco’s Pac-Man and Electronic Arts’ Tetris, have been revived and released by their publishers with their original IP (the format in which they were originally played) for mobile phones.


“There is always an interest in classics. In the film industry you would see classics getting remade after every few years.

"Prominent among the top issues that have not been highlighted in the 2019 manifesto are the return of black money stashed in foreign bank accounts and cow protection. The omission of the issue of stray cattle is also crucial as it is a major source of concern for farmers.


However, a senior leader of the party who was involved in the preparation of the manifesto denied that these issues were omitted. “There is no omission of these issues in the manifesto. Protection of cows, job creation are some of the main issues. The party is committed to protecting cows and when we talk about promoting entrepreneurship, it is also job creation. The BJP has always valued centre-state relations and respected the federal structure that is why the party continued with its alliance partners though BJP got majority in 2014 general elections,"" said the BJP leader.


BJP leaders maintained that the omission of an issue from the manifesto does not mean that the party has dropped the idea. Members of the BJP explained that the manifesto is a vision document that talks about the future plans of the party and not mentioning an issue in the manifesto it does not mean that the party has given up on its old promises.


Another big difference between the two manifestos is that for the first time the BJP has crowd sourced the process of manifesto preparation, with the party saying it got at least 60 million suggestions from people and that its senior leaders spoke to at least 100 experts.

"Digging into a plateful of Tunday Kebabs later that evening at the celebrated Chowk outlet of this delicacy, Ali, 25, had two words to offer in his appraisal of Modi’s record: “Nothing good."" Why? “Fake news, these EVM (electronic voting machine) things, lynchings…"" he replied, pausing to warn me gently not to get him started. “Saw him on TV with Akshay Kumar?"" he asked me, “‘I’m this, I’m that…’ Modi loves Modi."" That the object of this televised lovefest was poised for victory, however, was not in dispute to his mind. “Modi will be back.""


That refrain had chased me down the alley, almost like a discreet advisory to quit asking silly questions. “It’s like this,"" an amused observer would later quip, “This seat is reserved.""


My app-hailed cabbie of the day, in contrast, had veered around to the view that Lucknow was up for grabs. Sinha could swing some upper-crust voters away from the BJP, he’d guessed, while Krishnam had earned himself his own appeal spanning the religious divide; and last but not least, the BJP’s Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s “Bajrang Bali versus Ali"" could yet reverse a sectarian wedge driven by the party. What Vajpayee had once gained, Yogi’s blow of the conch would lose.


How sizeable a swing that might be seemed like a touchy topic in the old city, but Ali indulged me all the same. A few Maulanas making pro-BJP or pro-Mandir noises, only evoked shrugs among youngsters like him and his buddy, he said. “I’m Sunni and he’s Shia,"" he added, referring to his co-diner, and he wouldn’t listen to Maulanas, would he? “Only if they make sense,"" replied Ali’s friend, duly startled. It was best, the table figured, to leave it at that.


Every city may have its own andaaz, a distinct manner of getting views across, but Lucknow appeared to have mastered the art of doing so in riddles. It’s done for a variety of purposes. To cushion a blow, perhaps, or not let on too much, especially not to a tactless out-of-towner.


The device of taqiya, after all, has a history going back centuries in these parts, the tactical adoption of a stance aligned with the most acceptable view. That it would still be in practice here was no surprise once the dots began to reveal a pattern. How widely it was employed across the city by people of all faiths alike, however, left me agape.


But then, whichever way Uttar Pradesh tilts the country this summer, almost everybody could say they told me so. On a tiny sample of sentiment in the state’s capital, my hunch was that Amit Shah’s playbook wouldn’t pull his party through.",0

"“After 19 years of BJD rule, people are migrating from Odisha in search of jobs. But the chief minister won’t talk about unemployment and structural reforms,"" said Aparajita Sarangi, a state BJP leader.


BJD leaders have a ready counter-narrative. They believe that migration in the state is not forced. In a vast country like India workforce mobility is a natural phenomena and it adds to the “remittance economy"", explained Bhartruhari Mahtab, a veteran BJD leader.


Mahtab asserted that notwithstanding an aggressive campaign by the BJP, chief minister Naveen Patnaik will win a fifth term in office. Patnaik, a political novice, had formed BJD in 1997 after the death of his father Biju Patnaik. He has remained the chief minister since March 2000.


Early in his political career, Naveen Patnaik had realised three things—the economic disadvantage of the state, the power of women as voters, and the emotional connect his father enjoyed as a leader. He has had varying degrees of success in all three aspects over the last 19 years. He created more than 700,000 women self-help groups, gave them financial help, made them self-reliant and got their votes.

"LG has unveiled a rollable TV a 65-inch screen that can roll down and disappear into its base with the press of a button


Las Vegas: The CES 2019 gadget show is revving up in Las Vegas. Here are the latest findings and observations from Associated Press reporters on the ground as technology’s biggest trade event gets underway.


In this age of smartphone streaming, big television sets are no longer the centerpiece of many living rooms. South Korean electronics company LG is doing its part to make TVs disappear.


LG has unveiled a “rollable"" TV — a 65-inch screen that can roll down and disappear into its base with the press of a button. The set can still play music when the screen’s rolled down completely, or display a clock when it’s just partially rolled down. LG says the TV will be available later this year. It didn’t say how much it will cost.


Meanwhile, LG, Samsung and others unveiled “8K"" sets, with four times the resolution as the high-definition sets of today and twice that of 4K sets such as LG’s rollable one. It represents the next generation of television viewing, but many people won’t have access to for quite some time. So far, 8K has been limited to the occasional experimental broadcast, such as during the Olympics. Even 4K content is just catching on.


“As always with TVs, innovations come with display hardware first and adoption of things like content and delivery always follow later,"" said Paul Gagnon, an analyst with IHS Markit.",1

"The Congress has made numerous promises in its manifesto, and you too have taken a dig at them in your election speeches. What do you make of the congress manifesto?


Look at the Congress track record. In 2004, they promised electricity for every household in three years. In 2009, they said electrification can happen in urban areas and for rural areas it will take more time but even till 2014 this had not happened.


After coming to power in 2014, we have provided electricity to 18,000 villages, almost 25 million households have benefited from it. In the near future, electricity will reach every house in India.


Look at their track record in Punjab, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh where they announced farm loan waivers, but have not done anything about it. Similar promises were made by the Congress in 2009 also. They said they would waive loans of ₹6 trillion but did only for ₹52,000 crore.


There is a CAG report on it which says there were five million bogus beneficiaries of the loan waiver scheme. Who will trust a party which has a track record like this? Besides, after winning elections in the states, they announced doles for unemployed youth. Till now they haven't given anything.


Since Nehru’s time, the Congress has claimed that poverty eradication is their goal. However, the Congress has paid lip service to it—Nehru used the slogan, then Indira Gandhi used it, Rajiv Gandhi spoke about it, Sonia Gandhi too said poverty eradication is their goal and now, her son too speaks about poverty eradication. For five generations the Congress has used this slogan.


The Congress has become like the main protagonist in the Ghajini movie. They don’t remember the promises they have made in earlier manifestos.


The Congress had in the past promised direct income and a high minimum support price to farmers but they forgot it. Then they promised electricity for every household; that too is forgotten. In 2009, they promised broadband connectivity in every village, and now in 2019, again they are repeating the same promise.


Has the Congress in the last 72 years given even 71 paise to the poor ? The people of India know this very well.


A section of the intellectuals in the society have given a call to not vote for you. How do you see this development?


I don’t know who these people are, but there was definitely a section of people, which got the best of everything under the previous governments. They got awards, respect, their children got scholarships and even studied in foreign countries.


It is possible that it is these people who give such calls. They probably can’t contest elections directly so they resort to such tactics. But so far no body has heard them and they should now introspect.


The government has taken effective action against Maoists in the northeast, but why couldn't it be as effective in Jammu and Kashmir?


I do not agree that the condition in Kashmir is not good. This is a 40-year-old problem and there have been interruptions, but you will see that only two, two-and-a-half districts in Jammu, Ladakh and Srinagar valley are left where the condition is not good.


Local-level elections were not held for many years in the Srinagar valley. Earlier governments were obstructions. Right now we have conducted elections. Seventy-five percent polling took place and there was not a single violent incident. Hundreds of people were killed in panchayat elections in West Bengal, but there was no single incident in Kashmir. Are conditions bad in Bengal or in Kashmir?


In Kashmir, NIA (National Investigation Agency) took action. The people of Kashmir were cheering in groups. Earlier, there was no action against people, who indulged in corruption to gain higher positions. Now, our government has taken action against them.


Recently there was a football match. There were 25,000 people watching the match, and the local team had defeated a famous team of Kolkata. Such news doesn't get publicity.


In a way rapid development is taking place. The task to provide electricity to every household was completed last month. Several major decisions have been taken under the governor's regime.


Don’t you think that the decision to form the government with Mehbooba Mufti in Jammu and Kashmir was not a right decision?


When the election results came, no one had absolute majority. We were thinking that the National Conference and the PDP (The Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party) will join hands. We did not have the numbers. The state was under governor’s rule for several months. At that time Mufti Mohammed Saeed was there. People of the state spoke to him. We openly said that ""we are two poles"".


In a way it was our mahamilawat. Because we had to form a government under democratic compulsions, we started working under the minimum common programme.


Mufti saheb was experienced...so there were no problems. After the demise of Mufti saheb, Mehbooba Mufti had compulsions of the party and other problems. She was not ready to take the responsibility for several days. After a long time she took the responsibility. The government was formed. We wanted to conduct local elections, but she was not ready. She used to say that there would be bloodshed. When she did not conduct elections, then we left (the coalition).


We focused on development. We already said whatever mahamilawat is visible today was our mahamilawat and whatever political damage it could do, it did.


You adopted the principle of zero tolerance against terrorism. Do you think that the narrative has changed after Pulwama?


The whole world is fighting against terrorism. Our effort is to make terrorism a global agenda and tell the world that Pakistan is in the business of exporting terror to India.


Pulwama has convinced the world that what India says is right. Because of that the entire world supported us when the air strikes were conducted.",0

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a massive roadshow in Varanasi on Thursday, a day before he is set to file nomination papers in the Lok Sabha elections for a second consecutive term from the holy city.


Varanasi residents turned out in large numbers to show their support for the PM, likely spelling bad news for the newly minted Bahujan Samaj Party-Samajwadi Party alliance that is hoping to upset the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) applecart in Uttar Pradesh.

"Progressive groups have been urging the Federal Trade Commission to carve up Facebook and split off its popular services Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger into their own companies. In January, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook is planning to integrate the chat tools of those products, making a breakup harder to accomplish if the services are more tightly intertwined. The move has also increased concerns about transparency into how Facebook’s data collection works.


Privacy regulations 'should protect your right to choose how your information is used -- while enabling companies to use information for safety purposes and to provide services,' he said. 'It shouldn’t require data to be stored locally, which would make it more vulnerable to unwarranted access.'


Zuckerberg also said there should also be rules guaranteeing portability of data that protects information when it moves between services.


The Facebook chief’s statement was in keeping with his efforts this year to frame the company’s more critical problems as part of broader issues for the internet at large. Zuckerberg’s willingness to embrace regulation could pave the way toward taking the thorniest problems about speech and privacy out of Facebook’s hands -- or at least give the company more time to solve them.",1

"Because an unconstrained investor can buy or sell almost any instrument, Gross no longer was reined in by the limits on risk-taking inherent in an index.

These days, it’s fashionable to blame the chronic underperformance of active managers on the growth of passive products—index and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—and quantitative strategies such as momentum and trend-following.


What active managers really object to, he says, is the increasing pressure on fees.

During the summer before the 2016 presidential election, John Seymour and Philip Tully, two researchers with ZeroFOX, a security company in Baltimore, unveiled a new kind of Twitter bot. By analysing patterns of activity on the social network, the bot learned to fool users into clicking on links in tweets that led to potentially hazardous sites.


The bot, called SNAP_R, was an automated “phishing"" system, capable of homing in on the whims of specific individuals and coaxing them toward that moment when they would inadvertently download spyware onto their machines. “Archaeologists believe they’ve found the tomb of Alexander the Great is in the US for the first time: goo.gl/KjdQYT,"" the bot tweeted at one unsuspecting user.


Even with the odd grammatical misstep, SNAP_R succeeded in eliciting a click as often as 66% of the time, on par with human hackers who craft phishing messages by hand.


The bot was unarmed, merely a proof of concept. But in the wake of the election and the wave of concern over political hacking, fake news and the dark side of social networking, it illustrated why the landscape of fakery will only darken further.


The two researchers built what is called a neural network, a complex mathematical system that can learn tasks by analysing vast amounts of data.

"The digitization of mobility has brought the concept of ‘a ride’, which can be understood as a function of a seat in a vehicle used by more than one person. In digital economy terms, we call this MaaS, Mobility as a Service.


While traditional transit, including metros, buses and rickshaws are also mobility in the form of a service, they have not yet catered to the aspirations of the hyper-connected user. The key transformation is to make ‘a ride’ into a replacement for the aspiration of ‘a drive’, and integrate the traditional modes as a service to users.


Still dominated by traditional shared mobility India’s timing for growth makes it a promising candidate to leverage digitization to do urban mobility differently. With vehicle ownership expected to rise exponentially there is an urgent need to expand digitization to seamlessly connect para-transit and public transport. The majority of mobility use cases can be served better by MaaS, or Mobility as a Service, than by ownership.


There are signs of a shift globally too. Germans under 25 obtaining a driving licence have declined 28% in a decade, which is a sign of people postponing their decision to buy a car as on-demand mobility services are available. It is estimated that by 2030, car sales in the US will fall almost 12% and this has led to auto manufacturers investing in ride-hailing service providers. Such signs are visible in India too now with manufacturers entering the mobility service space, the launch of ‘One Nation, One Card’, and the strong backing of new economy ventures doing everything from scooter-sharing to last-mile transportation.


Thirdly, it is critical to embrace and accelerate digitization. The idea of ‘Digital India’ holds particular promise for reinventing the city by revolutionizing mobility.


With over one billion cell phone users and 432 million 4G consumers, internet penetration has created fertile ground for further digitizing public services, which can have more impact than mobility.",1

"The Congress has hinted at doing away with some subsidies, sharing the cost with the state governments and raising new taxes. The total food, fertilizer and oil subsidies in 2019-20 are expected to be at ₹2.97 trillion, or 1.41% of the GDP. The point is that if the government is carrying out an income transfer to citizens, are the subsidies and many other government programmes really required?


As Subramanian writes in Of Counsel: “Currently, the government spends a lot of money to help the poor through a variety of schemes such as the MGNREGA, Janani Suraksha Yojana, PDS, fertilizers, MSPs, electricity, Integrated Child Development Services … Indira Awaas Yojana, National Livelihoods Mission, Ujjwala to name a few. In 2014-15, we conservatively estimated that there were more than a thousand central schemes, and many have been in place for a long time. (There is even one that is 96 years old.)""


NYAY can be a good way to rationalize the number of schemes run by the central government and improve state capacity i.e. the capacity to deliver on things, instead of just launching new schemes every year. Also, many of these schemes have huge leakages and are not well targeted. As Subramanian writes: “About only one-third of the fertilizer subsidy reaches small farmers; nearly 40% of the PDS kerosene was lost to leakage and about half the remainder reached the poor… Even the MGNREGA, which is self-selecting has an issue: expenditure are not highly correlated with places with the most extreme poverty.""


In this scenario, it makes a lot of sense to give money to people directly and let them do what they want to do with it. The problem is this will involve doing away with many existing systems, and hence, is easier said than done. Given this, removing all subsidies will be difficult and hence, taxes are likely to go up. As far as increasing taxes are concerned, economists who have studied UBI in detail in the Indian context, have suggested the return of wealth tax, a tax on agricultural income and an estate tax to maintain intergenerational equity.


A tax on agricultural income makes tremendous sense given that it is a major conduit for converting black money into white. The trouble is that these taxes will hurt the influential section of the economy i.e. the wealthy. Hence, it remains to be seen if they are implemented. Nevertheless, if the NYAY scheme has to become a reality, the money has to come from somewhere, and given that higher taxes in some form cannot really be ruled out.


Another big issue with NYAY will be the perpetual problem of identifying the right beneficiaries for the scheme. This can play spoilsport with the scheme as well. Having said that, basic income scheme is an idea whose time has come. The extreme poverty, with people in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh earning a very low income—which is a fraction of the incomes in other states—needs to be tackled on a war footing.",0

"“It is better to be over-capitalized than under-capitalized amid the continued uncertainty in the Indian wireless market. A well-capitalized balance sheet is a must to fight the ‘brutal battle of capital and capacity’ that the Indian wireless market currently is,"" say analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to clients.


Vodafone Idea comes across as the weakest placed in this brutal battle. Compared to peers Reliance Jio and Airtel, the company has been lagging in capital expenditure (capex), say analysts. As Rajiv Sharma of SBICAP Securities points out, “Government (department of telecommunication) dues coming up for payment in the next two years itself amount to ₹21,000 crore for Vodafone Idea, leaving limited scope for tactical investments such as 5G.""


The Indian telecom industry is experiencing the “escalation of commitment"" problem, where the tendency to escalate capital commitments ends up being disastrous for firms, especially in hypercompetitive markets. The coffee wars in the US between Philip Morris’s Maxwell House and Procter and Gamble’s Folgers brands is a classic example, where both companies struggled to make money thanks to their fight for dominance.


As pointed out in a Mint article, citing research from Kotak, what the telecom industry really needs is so-called de-escalation bids such as an increase in tariffs. Instead, the path the industry has chosen is to escalate their commitments. Of course, one can argue that they have little choice but to keep pumping in money to protect their already large investments. But as history has shown, this strategy doesn’t end very well.",3

"It is also important to note that even if there were major national sentiments that parties may want to focus on (security, patriotism, unemployment and the like), this election will not be one single result, but 29 different results. It is clear that the factors and forces that will determine this result will be different in each state and even the ""national"" issues will play out very differently in each state. The state and regional variation will be critical to explaining the electoral trends.


Elections 2019 is clearly going to witness an attempt to seek support on two competing narratives. The BJP and its electoral partners are clearly going to pitch this election on leadership, viewed from the prism of national security, patriotism and a ""particular"" idea of India. This will clearly play out differently in different regions of the country. While it has the potential to gain some visibility in the north and west of India, its likely impact on the south and east remains debatable.


On the other hand, those opposing the BJP would like to focus the floodlight of attention on issues of unemployment, price rise, economy and the performance of the BJP government as contrasted with the promises made during the last election. There is also a desperate bid on the part of the principal opposition party to position corruption as the key electoral issue.

"Many newer smartphones include multiple camera lenses that let you produce different camera effects. For example, last year’s iPhone XS included a rear camera with dual lenses; the two lenses worked together to blur the background while sharpening a subject in the foreground, producing what’s known as the bokeh effect.


Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus take this up another notch. Both include a triple camera system arranged horizontally on the back of the phone. The left lens is for zooming, the middle lens contains the main camera, and the right lens features a brand-new ultrawide angle lens for capturing broader shots, like landscapes or a big group gathering at Thanksgiving dinner.


What’s more, the Galaxy S10 5G will have a fourth camera for depth-sensing, which will enable richer augmented-reality applications that use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through the smartphone lens.


Expect other companies to keep beefing up the number of cameras this year. Apple also plans to add another camera to some of its next iPhones, according to a person briefed on the company’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Apple declined to comment.


Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 5G will be one of the first phones to work with 5G wireless networks, which are a successor to current 4G networks. These new networks will introduce internet speeds so fast that devices will be able to download high-quality videos in a few seconds.


But contain your excitement for now. The carriers are still far from deploying a broad 5G network. AT&T said it should have 5G deployed in 21 cities in the first half of this year. Verizon Wireless just did its first 5G data test on a smartphone late last year. There isn’t expected to be much traction for the new cellular technology until 2020.


And even when 5G does reach your hometown, there may be confusion about it. In a controversial move, AT&T said that it planned to give different flavors of 5G different names: 5G will be the fastest speed taking advantage of brand-new infrastructure, and 5GE will essentially be a faster version of 4G using upgraded 4G equipment.",1

"Economists, however, said that irrespective of the political party in office, India needs to spend much more on health and education than it currently spends or is promised by political parties to achieve the sustainable development goals the country has committed to. Currently, India spends about 1.15% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health and around 2.7% of GDP on education. The Congress manifesto promises the right to universal healthcare and expands the scope of Right to Education till Class XII, and also makes an ambitious pitch of allocating 6% of GDP to education and increasing health care expenditure to 3%, both by 2023-24.

Instead they are left to create their own proprietary standards for communication, where security is not always a top priority,"" said Vladislav Iliushin, IoT Threat Reseacher at Avast.


One of the biggest challenges in security of IoT devices is they are low in both memory and compute power, which makes it hard to put agents on them like anti-virus, explains Venkat Krishnapur, vice president-engineering and managing director of McAfee India. Also, when a vulnerability is discovered, the patch to address it is unlikely to be pushed automatically to the device, leaving it open to attacks.",1

The primary module consists of 24MP+5MP sensors with Phase Detection Autofocus and f/1.7 aperture. The wide-angle camera has an 8MP sensor at its heart while the telephoto camera has a 10MP sensor and provides 2x optical zoom.

RAIPUR: People of Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district defied security threats and calls for a boycott of the Lok Sabha elections by the Naxalites to record a 56% voter turnout in the first phase of the polls on Thursday, according to the state’s chief electoral officer.


The elections this year in Bastar, the centre of Naxalite activity in the state, were held just two days after the an improvised explosive device (IED) blast killed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Dantewada, Bhima Mandavi. Shyamgiri, where Mandavi and four security force personnel were killed, recorded a voter turnout of 70%.


The elections in tribal-dominated Bastar, which had recorded a 59% voter turnout during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, assume added significance with Naxalites having stepped up attacks to ensure that there is no development permeates in the Dandakaranya forest region, which spans close to 5,000 square miles of uncharted land.",0

“The meeting of 21 parties expressed their deep anguish over the blatant politicization of the sacrifices made by our Armed Forces by leaders of the ruling party,"" said the joint statement released after the meeting.

He points out that technology now allows companies to track the number of people who listen to a podcast; the device it is being consumed on; and the demographics. “Using technology, we can also stitch audio ads within podcasts,"" he adds.

"Karl Marx, the prophet of the organized Left, argued that Communism is the solution to workers’ plight in industrial societies. On International Labour Day, the workers on the train are proof that such a Communist utopia has not yet arrived despite the presence of an organized Left dating back to before Independence.


Further south, India’s only ruling Communist chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who has been gaining middle class support in Kerala, is currently preparing for a two-week trip to London starting 8 May to attend the listing of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board ‘masala bonds’ (rupee-denominated bonds issued overseas) under an escrow mechanism he has set up to raise revenue for the state.

Zuckerberg’s move to take more control of Facebook’s disparate businesses follows two years of scrutiny of its core social network, which has been criticized for allowing election meddling and the spread of disinformation. Those and other issues have slowed Facebook’s growth and damaged its reputation, raising the hackles of lawmakers and regulators around the globe. Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized and vowed to fix the problems.


Knitting together Facebook’s apps is a stark reversal of Zuckerberg’s previous stance toward WhatsApp and Instagram, which were independent companies that he acquired. At the time that Facebook bought the firms, Zuckerberg promised WhatsApp and Instagram plenty of autonomy from its parent company. (Facebook Messenger was a homegrown messaging service, spun out of the main Facebook app in 2014.)


WhatsApp and Instagram have since grown tremendously, prompting a change in Zuckerberg’s thinking, said one of the people. The chief executive now believes tighter integration will benefit Facebook’s entire “family of apps"" over the long term by making them more useful, the person said. Zuckerberg had floated the integration idea for months and began promoting it more heavily to employees toward the end of last year, the people said.


The effort has caused internal strife. Instagram’s founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, abruptly left Facebook last fall after Zuckerberg began weighing in more. WhatsApp’s founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, departed for similar reasons. More recently, dozens of WhatsApp employees clashed with Zuckerberg over the integration plan on internal message boards and during a contentious staff meeting in December, said four people who attended or were briefed on the event.


The changes may also raise questions of data privacy because of how user information may be shared between the services. Today, WhatsApp requires people to register only a phone number to sign up for the service. By contrast, Facebook and Facebook Messenger ask users to provide their real identities. Matching Facebook and Instagram users to their WhatsApp handles could give pause to those who prefer keeping their use of each app compartmentalized.",1

"Apple has doubled down on digital services as consumers cling to older iPhone models, hurting sales. Apple's iPhone revenue this year is expected to drop by 15% from last year $141 billion, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.


Services, by contrast, are expected to generate about $46 billion in revenue this year, according to the same survey. Schachter estimates the app store will account for $16 billion of the services revenue. By those estimates, both services and app store revenue will have doubled in just three years.


Apple didn't respond to the AP's inquiries about its app fees. It has previously defended the system as reasonable compensation for reviewing all apps and ensuring its store remains a safe and secure place for e-commerce. Google charges similar fees in its own app store, although its overall business isn't as dependent on them.


Besides the app fees, Apple's services division includes revenue from its Apple Music streaming service, iCloud storage, Apple Care, Apple Pay and ad commissions that Google pays to be the iPhone's built-in search engine. Apple is also expected to roll out its own streaming-video service this spring, although few details are available.


The potential streaming competition from Apple may have triggered Netflix decision's to bar customers from paying for new video subscriptions through its iPhone app. Instead, it directs users to its website, thus avoiding the extra fees. (Netflix did likewise with Google's app store last year.)


Netflix alone won't put a significant dent in Apple's finances, even though it paid Apple more money last year than any other non-gaming app, according to App Annie, a firm that tracks the app market. That sum came to about $110 million, accounting for just 0.3% of the services division revenue, based on disclosures made in Apple's earnings calls last year.

MUMBAI: The rally that’s lifted India’s $2.2 trillion stock market to a record has prompted a veteran hedge fund manager to load up on bearish wagers in a fund launched two months ago.

"In the last few years, there has been growing awareness of the user’s rights to his data, though principally through the data privacy route. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations, which came into effect in May this year, give people extensive rights to check, download, and even delete personal data held by companies. That is a beginning.


Competition could be another way forward. If other tech giants like Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which use some free data but are far behind Google and Facebook on this, and also on the AI front, start paying, it could force the Big Two to follow. Google already outsources work like testing the efficacy of its searches to more than 10,000 human beings (and pays them), but had been trying to keep it a secret.


Data as labour could even help tech giants. As AI grows more advanced, it will require better data, which people may provide if they get paid-


A third way could be if data labourers unionised and could collectively bargain with these companies. No individual has any bargaining power, but a union that can filter access to user data could possibly call a powerful strike.


As Lanier et al write: “Such a union could be an access gateway, making a strike easy to enforce. On a social network, where users would be pressured by friends not to break a strike, this might be particularly effective. A union could also be useful in certifying data quality and guiding users to develop their earning potential.""


The first such union was launched in the Netherlands in May this year—Datavakbon or Data Labour Union. It hopes to elect leaders to directly negotiate with Google and Facebook over what they do with users’ data.


According to Reuters, “volunteers are working on tools to make it possible for the union to organize a ‘strike’, which would involve temporarily depriving the companies of some of the most valuable information they sell to advertisers, such as location data. Possible demands could include payment for the data that users supply to the companies; more information about how the data is used; and a direct channel for communicating grievances."" Membership is free.


But how do you price data as labour? The first hurdle is that the concept blurs the boundaries between work and leisure. After all, much of the data the monopsonies are glutting on is produced during consumption rather than any dedicated activity. This will require a great amount of economic and technical sophistication.",1

"While the rush to return excess cash to investors is driven by the tax efficiency of buybacks over dividends, declining share values and a slowing global economy has helped accelerate the trend.

New Delhi: In a bid to prevent the spread of fake news on its platform ahead of Elections 2019, Facebook Inc. plans to start an operations centre in Delhi, which will coordinate with the social media giant’s offices at Menlo Park (California), Dublin and Singapore, on a 24x7 basis to monitor election content, said Shivnath Thukral, director, public policy, India and South Asia, Facebook.",0
"Experts however, argued that the low turnout would not have any bearing on the political fates of leaders, even though the process was far from “democratic.""


“The leadership has nothing to sell to the electorate. Political parties come to power in Jammu and Kashmir because the people have no choice. They are not happy with either the PDP or the NC. The parties come to power by default. You are not required to have a minimum number of votes so as to be elected. So even if a candidate gets one vote and nobody else votes, you can come to power. Political leaders have not fulfilled public expectation. Unless you have full people’s participation, you cannot test democracy,"" said Nisar Ali, former dean of faculty of social sciences at the University of Kashmir.",0
"Experts say it is just a matter of time before more countries pass legislation on the matter, but meanwhile, where rules are absent, what happens in the digital afterlife remains obscure.


""Solicitors are quite confused (in Britain) as to what happens and they sometimes advise their clients to leave password and user names attached to their will, which is nonsense,"" said Harbinja.


Wills are public documents in the country and passwords change, she noted, allowing for massive privacy violations.


Some, like David Haynes, a research fellow at London's City University, fear growing public resentment over cases of data misuse by social media could result in blanket requirements for all data to be automatically deleted after death.


Harbinja said that everything purely personal should be deleted, but heirs should be given the option to access copyrighted material and other assets of value.


Fielding of Protecture said that legislation would be difficult to apply, with many people holding different social accounts, sometimes under pseudonyms.


It would be easier to ask social platforms to provide users with an option to name a digital executor by default, she said.


""It won't solve all the issues, and probably wouldn't be taken up in large numbers by very young people, but it's better than nothing,"" she added.",1

"The signs of a recession in the US were already there and were the very reason for the Fed’s dovish stance, said Amit Gupta, analyst at ICICIdirect. “The first leg of these recession fears has been positive for the Indian rupee because we are seeing more foreign flows.

But RBI may not let the rupee’s appreciation continue beyond a point and we may see some intervention to aid export competitiveness,"" he said.

One such report by App Annie, published in January 2019, suggests that the total number of app downloads have risen by 35% on both Android and iOS in the last two years, while in India, it has surged 165%.

"Mumbai-based Vernika Awal uses an antivirus application for her Android smartphone. However, she has never noticed the app detecting any malware on her device. Awal wondered whether it is because there are no viruses on her phone, or whether the app she downloaded doesn’t work.


The fact is that Android and iOS smartphones theoretically do not need antivirus software. At least not in the traditional sense, as they were used for Windows-based desktop computers. That’s because these are Unix-based systems and cannot be infected automatically the way Windows systems can.


They have a “sandbox"" design, which separates the app layer from the rest of the system, making them more difficult to attack.

Imagine you are sipping coffee at a cafe during your break, and your smartphone pings to remind you that the holidays are around the corner—it’s time to plan a getaway.

You conference with your friend and tour a scenic location together online.


The virtual tour replicates not just the sights, but also the sounds and smells one might experience. The final location is decided and you pick flights, hotels, and excursions using virtual/augmented tours. You link your biometric data to be used at the time of customs, hotels and airline check-in.

You see a cobweb of broad roads, eroding green spaces and busy traffic. There are flyovers, railways over and under bridges, cement roads, new markets, hospitals and shopping malls everywhere. Several old buildings are being redeveloped. New hotels are mushrooming. It’s a mindless expansion of slums juxtaposed with budget apartments and a few ultra-modern housing sandwiched in between.


Helmet-clad labourers—mostly migrants from the northern and eastern India—are working on the slabs of the under-construction metro stations, iron bars emanating from their beams. The riders don’t look like daily commuters. Most of them are new migrants who have arrived here to make a living. They are curious citizens drawn by the novelty of Nagpur’s Majhi Metro, a ₹8,680 crore mass rapid transit project that will run 41 kilometres on east-west, north-south corridors in the first phase being showcased by the BJP at the start of the general elections as the face of a changing Nagpur, changing India. Questions remain about its viability.


You see students with designer bags in their peculiar uniforms; they appear to be engineering or business administration students. Some of them seem to have come from neighbouring cities. Tens of new private colleges have come up in the last few years, so you don’t know who’s from which institution. As the metro chugs on, you hear a chatter in different dialects of Marathi and Hindi. People in the metro are excited. For them this is big—they behave like a child who’s discovered a new toy.


The city needed something to boast of: metro rail, cement roads, big projects are just about that. In the past, we would boast about having the Asia’s biggest government hospital—never mind it was untrue; Asia’s biggest industrial estate—with hardly any industry there worth a mention; we planned India’s first air cargo hub, which never really took off. The list goes on. There is no other city that calls itself the second capital, a term it discovered for itself to nurse its dented ego of having to give up its capital status post reorganization of states in 1960.


Nagpur used to be the greenest city—and a genuine one at that—for a very long time, the green dense patches of planted and natural trees coupled with many community gardens working as its lungs. The British created here the Victoria Technical Institute—later renamed as the College of Agriculture—to create sprawling lush green farms on both sides of the Nag river. We turned Nag river into our big sewer system and farm lands into cement pastures.


Today, the planners have messed up with its design big time. It’s losing its greenness and its aesthetics. In a major spell of rains in July 2018, the city came to a standstill, its infrastructure crumbled.


It’s been a month that the metro rail got operational and the joy rides are not ending. This is one of the four metro corridors opened for commercial operation before the Model Code of Conduct came into vogue ahead of the general elections. The Khapri-Sitabuldi leg will not perhaps be the busiest of the four planned routes like the one from Sitabuldi to Hingna or East Nagpur.


“Metro rail is a plan to alter Nagpur,"" says Pradyumna Sahasrabhojanee, architect and member of the Vidarbha Heritage Society. “It won’t be quite the same city."" “It’s quite astonishing that the British built a fort on Sitabuldi hills since it was a vantage point, and developed everything around the hill—the station, the assembly hall, the administrative building,"" says Sahastrabhojanee, an expert in Nagpur heritage structures. “Today’s infrastructure growth is an antithesis of a Nagpur envisioned by the early planners; it’s quite mindless,"" he says.


For four years, every single road got dug up, drilling went on uninterrupted to erect pillars for the metro rail, people bore frequent traffic jams and traffic diversions became a new normal.",0

""While the renewed risk appetite is seen boosting European and US stocks, investors should consider how much upside is left, given that markets have been actively pricing in the possible resolution to the trade saga.""

"This was clearly not the first time Modi deployed Pakistan and a hard-line policy against the neighbouring country in an election campaign. During the 2012 Gujarat assembly election campaign, Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat, had alleged that then prime minister Manmohan Singh was close to striking a deal with Pakistan to give Sir Creek in Gujarat to the neighbouring country, an allegation denied by the then Prime Minister’s Office. Later, during the 2017 Gujarat election campaign when Modi was the prime minister and the Congress had mounted a spirited challenge to the incumbent BJP, Modi accused Manmohan Singh and Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar of holding a “secret meeting"" with current and former Pakistan officials and also alleged that Pakistan was trying to interfere with Gujarat polls. This charge was also denied by the Congress party. But the Pakistan gamble seemed to have paid off for the BJP as it retained Gujarat after a close contest in which the Congress improved over its 2012 performance and Modi’s powerful campaign turned out to be the key differentiator.


While national security and a hard-line policy on terrorism have been part of the BJP’s 2019 election campaign, Modi invoking Pakistan in Gujarat and Rajasthan should be seen in the context of the high stakes for both the BJP and Congress in these two states. Besides Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat are among the states where the BJP is locked in a straight electoral duel with the Congress, unlike some states where there are significant third and fourth players. Also, Modi’s Pakistan line has to be seen against the backdrop of the recent electoral history of these states. Though it retained Gujarat in 2017 against a resurgent Congress, it was a narrow victory for the BJP which won 99 seats against the Congress’ 77 in the 182-member Gujarat assembly. In November 2018, the BJP lost Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan to the Congress. Together, these states account for 91 Lok Sabha seats and the BJP had won a stunning 88 of these in the 2014 elections. In fact, the BJP won all 26 and 25 seats in Gujarat and Rajasthan respectively and lost only two and one seats in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, respectively.",0

"This year’s iPhone models will include an upgraded Apple processor and use an updated Face ID sensor, a report said.


Apple Inc. plans to launch iPhones with a more-powerful 3-D camera as soon as next year, stepping up the company’s push into augmented reality, according to people familiar with the plans.


The rear-facing, longer-range 3-D camera is designed to scan the environment to create three-dimensional reconstructions of the real world. It will work up to about 15 feet from the device, the people said. That’s in contrast with the current iPhone 3-D camera system, which points toward users and operates at distances of 25 to 50 centimeters to power Apple’s Face ID facial-recognition feature.


Apple’s new system uses a laser scanner, rather than the existing dot-projection technology which doesn’t work as well over longer distances, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unreleased features. That’s just one of many new features -- including a third, more advanced camera, enhanced photo-capture tools and a more powerful chip -- that Apple plans to include in coming generations of iPhones, the people said.


The laser-powered 3-D camera would enhance augmented reality on the iPhone, allowing for more accurate depth perception and placement of virtual objects. It could also help the handset take photos that can better capture depth, the people said.

People see the work we have done. The second issue is about good governance. People know that there was a dysfunctional government during the Congress regime. Now we have an honest government that is working for the poor, which people appreciate. The third issue is national security and our ability to deal with terrorism and extremism.

"According to Sebi, this is how the alleged misdemeanour unfolded: The NSE had engaged the services of Infotech Financial Services Pvt. Ltd to build a liquidity index or LIX. This project, according to Sebi’s 40-page order, “involved inherent conflict of interest"". One of the directors at Infotech was Sunita Thomas, Shah’s sister-in-law, and wife of Suprabhat Lala, assistant vice-president, NSE.


Shah, who was on the board of National Securities Clearing Corp. Ltd in August 2012, failed to disclose this conflict of interest to NSE and its officials, the Sebi order said. This conflict of interest was ignored by Lala when the LIX project was awarded to Infotech.


Sebi also directed Lala, Thomas and Infotech not to associate with the securities markets. Infotech and its two directors, which includes Thomas, have been barred from providing services to any Sebi-registered entity for two years. Lala has also been barred for two years.

Across the country, less than 20,000 households lack electricity access, according to the government. Official data from Saubhagya, though, is prone to be misreported, as a previous Plain Facts column pointed out.


However, data from non-government sources also suggest that India is getting closer to complete household electrification. A 2018 survey of 9,000 households across India’s poorest states—Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal—by the centre for Electricity, Environment and Water (CEEW) showed that the share of rural households connected to the grid in these states increased 20 percentage points since the last such survey was conducted in 2015, and rose to 84%. According to the NFHS 2015-16 report, an average of 72% rural households in these states had access to electricity.


More than access to electricity, the bigger challenge for India now is providing better quality of electricity. Across the country, there are significant disparities in the number of hours households get electricity. For instance, the CEEW survey revealed that while West Bengal households get 20 hours of power supply on average, Jharkhand households receive only 9 hours.",0
"Some of the rise in net profits also reflects the changing nature of the business. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) banned asset management companies (AMCs) from paying upfront commissions and other such fees through their profit and loss accounts. This substantially lowered operating expenses as the payment of commissions fell substantially. Fees and other commissions declined sharply to ₹29.85 crore in the March quarter from ₹100 crore a year earlier. Ebitda margins climbed to 73.3% in the last quarter from 59.61% a year earlier.


There are more regulatory changes coming up that affect financials and, unfortunately for investors, the impact will be negative this time. Sebi has notified a cut in the total expense ratio (TER), which fund houses charge to manage assets. The new structure has introduced slabs, which progressively reduce total expenses. As a result, revenues of all large fund houses will be hit.",3

"Home-grown smartphone brands like Micromax and Intex once cornered 54% of market share. That is down to less than 10% today


mint-india-wire long-reads xiaomi smartphonesoppo smartphonessmartphonesmicromax mobile phonesintex phonelava smartphonesLavaVivo smartphonesTranssionSamsungnokiasmartphoneschinachinese smartphones


Four years ago, Micromax’s office in Gurugram was at par with the likes of Google. The multi-storeyed building had open spaces, rooms aplenty, and even balconies and terraces where parties could be thrown.


Today, the company operates out of a single floor in a common office complex in Gurugram. The once-swanky office now has only a few cabins, far fewer employees, and is quite cramped. Incidentally, in 2014, Counterpoint Research put Micromax at the helm of the booming Indian smartphone market. It even surpassed Samsung, and shipped more phones than any other brand in India. In fact, home-grown smartphone brands such as Micromax, Lava, and Intex once cornered nearly 54% of the market share. The same brands have a less than 10% market share today. What really happened?


A look back at the last few years shows home-grown smartphone brands losing their dominance to a gradual Chinese onslaught. Today, the top player in India is Xiaomi, accounting for 29.7% of all smartphone shipments (IDC data). The company—which introduced itself with competitively priced devices—has slowly built its base in the country over the past five years, and is now reaping the benefits.


In fact, according to data from IDC, four of the top five smartphone brands in India are from China—Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and Transsion hold the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th positions, respectively. Samsung, which ousted Nokia from the Indian market, remains at number two, but is feeling the heat as well.


Meanwhile, Intex (which did not offer comment for this story) and Micromax have both been selling consumer appliances. Micromax says it sells nearly a million TVs every year, while Intex’s website proudly declares itself to be the number one Indian LED TV brand. Intex has also dabbled with air-conditioners and speakers.


Chinese brands have always offered low prices, and they continue to do so. However, the market has also changed. Now, the low pricing of devices has become the bar that others have to compete against.


In one of its launch events in China some months ago, Lei Jun, CEO of Xiaomi, had said that if his company makes more than 5% net profit from its hardware business, it would aim to pass that benefit on to its customers.


According to an industry source closely involved with smartphone sales, Oppo and Vivo sell phones in India at a margin of about 12%. These two companies have traditionally sold phones at higher prices than Xiaomi, since they plied their trade in an offline-centric model in India.


In the offline space, companies incur higher overheads, which raise the overall cost of the device, and hence, the final price too. According to a distributor who requested anonymity, when Oppo and Vivo started dominating the offline segment, they were paying lots of money to retailers and distributors to keep their brands visible. Yet, that wouldn’t reflect on the prices of the actual products. “They would even pay for redecorating a retailer’s store,"" the source said.",1

The least the government could have done is to increase the sugarcane prices by ₹10, but the government did not do it,"" said Balyan, a resident of Sisoli village in the high-profile Muzaffarnagar constituency.


The constituency has become the epicentre of caste politics with Ajit Singh, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief and son of late prime minister Charan Singh, contesting against Sanjeev Balyan of the BJP. The contest between the two Jat community leaders is not just a political battle, it is also about the supremacy of the Jat voters who have a considerable presence in six of the eight UP constituencies going to polls in the first phase on 11 April.

"“Twelve members of my family died that day, including my father, mother, brother and his wife and their children,"" says Qasimi, who was born in Nellie, a hamlet lying just an hour’s drive from Guwahati.


The massacre has become inextricably linked with the violence surrounding the politics of identity in not only Assam, but also the wider north-eastern region.


Last year, Qasimi joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has swept to power in Assam, Tripura and Manipur and has friendly governments in all eight north-eastern states under the North-East Democratic Alliance. Qassimi’s decision may seem surprising, given allegations that the events of Nellie had undertones of right-wing Hindutva politics—the Bengali Muslims were killed after they defied calls for boycotting assembly elections that saw the Congress voted to power.


Qassimi says the people of Nellie paid the price of upholding democracy against the wishes of Assamese son-of-the-soil agitators. “We will not make the same mistake again,"" he said. “It is prudent to stay on the right side of the powers that be and move on with life for the sake of our children.""",0

However, he said there was more ammunition that the Congress could use against the Modi government, such as intolerance, lack of jobs, weak foreign policy and regional instability, besides peddling fake narratives and failures in the Kashmir policy, among others.


“Purely from a campaign perspective, I believe Congress should counter aggression with aggression. They need to infuse more energy and get into a frontal attack mode, to somewhat swing the anti-incumbency factor in their favour. But they are a very distant second at this point. Strategising like the Congress won’t help them in these elections. They need help to think and act like the BJP, to counter BJP.""",0

"A sculptor at work in Bhubaneswar. Artists claim that politicians have never offered them any road map for the revival of traditional art works.prashant k. nanda/mint


At 6.45pm, a car enters Raghurajpur village in Odisha’s Puri district. About half-a-dozen men, who were relaxing outside their homes, walked up to the car. “Come, visit our homes,"" the invitation was spontaneous and heartfelt.


In this heritage crafts village, every home is a workshop and every occupant an artist. It’s election time, but the colours of life have reached far beyond the colours of political affiliation in this hamlet—the epicentre of “pattachitra"" paintings for over 800 years.

"Despite such weaknesses, the BJP’s attitude towards the AIADMK reeks of hubris. The official picture released when the alliance was formally announced tells it all: Amit Shah is seated imperiously while OPS sits deferentially on the seat’s edge. To rub it in, Amit Shah declared that the alliance would be called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and not after the AIADMK. The AIADMK has little choice but to swallow these insults. The sole objective is to neutralize Dhinakaran’s challenge and establish itself as the true inheritor of Jayalalithaa’s votebank.


(From left) PM Narendra Modi with Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi Palaniswami and PMK founder S. Ramadoss in Chennai.


Unsure of being able to piggyback on the AIADMK alone, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which is influential among the powerful Vanniyar caste, has been roped in with two seats more than the BJP and a promised Rajya Sabha seat in future as a bonus. The combination of BJP’s religious communalism and PMK’s casteism cannot but alarm democratic forces. But that’s another story.


The incumbency factor is a millstone that can weigh down any ruling party. With the AIADMK and the BJP allying together, anti-incumbency must get raised to the power of two, and warm the cockles of many an opponent’s heart. But paradoxically, the rival DMK’s president, Stalin, appears to be on the backfoot.


Stalin has been groomed for the DMK’s mantle for decades now. Through various manoeuvres, he has risen to be the undisputed leader of the party. The demise of Karunanidhi may at best make little difference to the traditional vote bank. Even in the last two elections, Stalin practically led the DMK into battle though with indifferent results. If the DMK lost all seats in the 2014 elections, in the 2016 assembly elections, it managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. With a massive presence in the opposition (98 out of the 234 seats), Stalin has proved not up to the task of putting a government devoid of all popular consent on the mat. Even party faithfuls feel stumped by the distinct lack of proactive strategies.


From contesting the 2014 elections alone, Stalin has now veered towards building a broad alliance. However, the fact that 10 seats have been conceded to the Congress defies logic, especially when the Congress’s strike rate is pathetically low. Time and again the DMK has shown that in straight fights with the AIADMK, the DMK fares well. The vehemence of Stalin’s expression of annoyance with the PMK for its distasteful double-dealing, negotiating as it did simultaneously with both the AIADMK and the DMK, is not a good sign. The delayed seat sharing with junior partners such as the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and the Indian Union Muslim League has also not gone down well.


But all said, the ground reality still favours the DMK alliance. By what magnitude, will it be a close race, etc. will be revealed in May.",0
"Although India has only 3 robots for every 10,000 workers, enterprises are increasingly turning to robots to save manpower and cost


The adoption of robots has been slow in India. However, with more firms investing in digitization, the levels are set to increase


In early 2018, Thiruvananthapuram-based startup Genrobotics joined hands with the Kerala government to deploy a spider-shaped robot named Bandicoot to clean sewers and manholes in the city. The robot’s mechanical arms reached inside the manhole and reportedly cleaned out the sludge in a few minutes, a task that earlier required three people and several hours of hard labour.


Bandicoot is just a case in point. Governments and enterprises are increasingly turning to robots to save time, manpower and cost. Around 3,412 new industrial robots were installed in India in 2017— an increase of 30% over the 2,626 units that were installed in 2016, claims the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) report published in January, 2019.

"In Andhra Pradesh, for instance, on the two occasions when the BJP performed reasonably well (1999 and 2014), it did so in alliance with the TDP (Telugu Desam Party). In 2009, when the TDP withdrew from the NDA (National Democratic Alliance), the BJP suffered a humiliating defeat, winning no seats. Similarly, in Tamil Nadu, the last time it won a meaningful number of seats (four) was in 1999, when it was in alliance with the DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and Vaiko’s MDMK (Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam). Since then, the party has been blanked out completely, winning only a solitary seat in 2014 in Kanyakumari.


In these elections, the party so far remains without allies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, leaving K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Chandrababu Naidu as potentially decisive kingmakers in the overall verdict. A reported potential alliance with Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSRCP (Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party), which won eight seats in the 2014 elections, could boost the BJP’s prospects in Andhra Pradesh. However, the BJP can be more optimistic about its prospects in Tamil Nadu, where it has secured a pre-poll deal with the AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), the current ruling party in the state assembly and the winner of 37 seats in 2014.


This combined with the BJP itself competing in five seats could mean a marked improvement for the party in Tamil Nadu. But even these potential gains could be hindered by the potential Congress-DMK alliance.",0

While Rao has grown from strength to strength, Naidu faces an uphill task in both assembly and Lok Sabha polls


From being an aide to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu to emerging as his most vocal critic and rival, Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) has come a long way. Both leaders made history by becoming the first chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana after the bifurcation of AP in 2014. But while Rao, or KCR, has grown from strength to strength, Naidu faces an uphill task in both the upcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections.


Both encouraged defections from opposition parties after the 2014 assembly and Lok Sabha polls, but KCR’s most recent gamble to call for early elections after dissolving the assembly last year, has paid off. He pulled off a spectacular win in the 7 December polls, with the TRS winning 88 of the 119 seats. Moreover, nine of the Congress’s 19 legislators defected to the ruling party.",0

That said, some social media networks like the microblogging platform, Twitter, also carry short pornographic video clips and photos put out for promotion by publishers and performers, without facing backlash from the authorities.

The PS4’s dominance over Xbox One means most gamers will buy and play blockbuster titles such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 on Sony’s console. Even its virtual-reality business is getting a boost from this month’s critically-acclaimed Astro Bot.


Game titles, which typically make up 80% of the industry’s total revenue, are key to the PS4’s longevity. Sony has cut the price of its flagship console by just 25% since 2013, compared with reductions of at least 50% seen for previous consoles at the same point in their life cycle. With more room to lower prices and add to the PS4 user base, Sony is well positioned to bolster profitability through 2021, according to Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies.


The big question is whether PS4’s successor will be designed to embrace cloud gaming, include handheld gaming, move deeper into virtual and augmented reality — or all of the above. Sony has yet to set a date for what will presumably be called the PlayStation 5. One thing that gaming analysts and experts agree on is that the next-generation console will probably be backward-compatible, meaning users will be able to play PS4 games, and vice-versa. That will create a smoother transition, helping to keep gamers within Sony’s ecosystem and away from cloud-gaming rivals.",1

"The Porbandar-Rajkot Express is an entirely general class train. It does not have any air-conditioned cars or other classes of coaches. It leaves Porbandar at 2:30pm and makes 13 stops before reaching its destination at 6:45pm.


Last Tuesday, About 40 people, including farmers, students and a few employees, kept me for company in my coach when the train started from Porbandar. By the time the train reached the penultimate stop of Bhakti Nagar in Rajkot, the number had more than doubled.


A ticket for this four-hour-forty-five-minute journey costs ₹75, which is very impressive and much to the railway’s credit. The seven-coach train, with each coach having 90 seats, can legitimately accommodate up to 630 passengers.


Sir, it is befuddling how railway authorities expect four people to sit on a single berth—there are no separate seats— when across the country, a maximum of three people are assigned to a single berth. Again, to my surprise, only the lower berths of all the coaches had cushions; the overhead berths only had steel racks, which suggests they are meant to be used only for luggage. But the train is so overcrowded, that people squeeze themselves into these upper berths. It is barbaric to expect people to sit on seats made of metal slats.

"The internet was going to make us free and unleash human potential. How did we accept Uber as the high point?


Thirty years ago, one March day in 1989, at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, 33-year-old British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee handed his boss Mike Sendall a note, blandly titled Information Management: A Proposal. The abstract of the proposal read: “This proposal concerns the management of information about accelerators and experiments at CERN. It discusses the problems of loss of information about complex evolving systems and derives a solution based on a distributed hypertext system.""


Sendall read the proposal and wrote on its first page: “Vague but exciting…"" After some thought, he gave Berners-Lee the go-ahead. And the internet was born.


(Technically, no. What Berners-Lee—now Sir Tim Berners-Lee—invented was the World Wide Web, not the internet. The internet already existed; it was essentially a wide-area network (WAN) of computers which let the users talk to one another and share data. The internet is infrastructure while the Web is a service on top of that infrastructure. As someone put it, one can think of the internet as a bookstore and the Web as the collection of books in that store. So, Sir Tim’s invention made the internet what it is today. Thus, in practical terms, March 2019 marks 30 years of the Internet.)


It is obviously the ultimate cliché to say that the internet has immeasurably changed the world. There is perhaps no aspect of our lives—public or private—that has not been impacted by the net. It has been an immensely powerful force of good, and it has only covered half the planet’s people till now. We also know that there is much more that it can deliver—its scope is only limited by our imagination.


No one seems to have any clear figure about how much the internet has helped the global economy, except for a 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report which said: “The internet accounted for 21% of the gross domestic product growth in mature economies over the past five years. If we include the large, emerging economies of China, India, and Brazil, the internet accounted for 11% (of growth) over the past five (years)."" But that was 2011. Much has changed since then, especially in terms of the growth of the internet in China and India.


So why has Sir Tim Berners-Lee, in an interview to BBC earlier in March, said that global action is required to tackle the Web’s “downward plunge to a dysfunctional future""?


In an open letter (bit.ly/2VRCKWb) released on 12 March, Sir Tim said: “While the Web has created opportunity, given marginalized groups a voice, and made our daily lives easier…it’s understandable that many people feel afraid and unsure if the Web is really a force for good.""

For a generation that reached adulthood after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the support for a Ram Mandir at the disputed site appears most surprising .


Among the millennials and post-millennials, a similar proportion (roughly one-fifth) of both BJP-supporters and others believe it is for the court to decide whether a temple should be built at the disputed site or not. Less than one-tenth on both sides said they “don’t care"". However, the proportion of BJP-supporting youth who think a temple should be built on the site is far higher than among the youth supporting other parties. About 16% of BJP supporters said that “either way, we want communal harmony"". Among other youth, this proportion was higher at 24%.


BJP’s young supporters have a problem with meat, but a bigger beef with beef. Nearly 41% of the youth who don’t support the BJP consider eating beef acceptable. Among BJP loyalists, that proportion is nearly half (21%). BJP’s supporters also seem to have a problem with alcohol (see chart 3).",0

"While devices to consume content can change, two basic tenets on which TV thrives—knowledge and escapism—will drive the future. Photo: iStock


Television will retain pole position as the largest segment, but digital will overtake filmed entertainment in 2019 and print by 2021


The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true.


French post-structuralist philosopher and cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard’s theory from his 1981 text Simulacra and Simulation, that meaning in modern life has been replaced by symbols and that all human existence merely simulates reality, has become the future of television. Baudrillard claims that society has “replaced all reality and meaning with symbols and signs, and that human experience is of a simulation of reality"".


Reality itself has begun to imitate the model, which now determines the real world. “It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real,"" Baudrillard says. He calls this hyperreal. Baudrillard’s suggestion is not merely that postmodern culture is artificial. His point, rather, is that we have lost all ability to make sense of the distinction between nature and artifice. He argues that there are three “orders of simulacra"" : 1. It is the reflection of a basic reality (TV). 2. It masks and perverts a basic reality (Reality TV). 3. It bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum (hyperreality).


Hyperreality has different names—augmented reality, virtual reality or connected reality. The premise of this essentially is the lack of ability to distinguish between the reality and a simulation of something, which is at the heart of all conversations around future of television or entertainment. “In five years and beyond we really imagine a world where commerce, education, entertainment are sort of intertwined very easily in living room itself or in any content consumption experience,"" said Amit Goenka, chief executive officer, ZEE International and Z5 Global, ZEE Entertainment Enterprise Ltd.",1

Many of the city’s rich helped build some of these institutes: The Sarabhai family helped set up the National Institute of Design while Kasturbhai Lalbhai, co-founder of Arvind Mills, helped establish IIM Ahmedabad.


Ahmedabad is demarcated into two constituencies: the city’s eastern section, an industrial neighbourhood, which has a large migrant population, and the western part, which has a larger Muslim population. Together, the two constituencies have 3.45 million voters.


In terms of civic infrastructure, residents demand better public transport and waste disposal. “Unlike slums in other large Indian cities, many slums in Ahmedabad have access to municipal services because of the government’s earlier Slum Networking Project, a UN-backed project to provide basic infrastructure,"" says Joshi. The construction of the metro is still underway and many of the newer areas of the city are not connected by bus services. The existing fleet is not large enough to serve the daily commuters. “We need at least 1,000 more buses,"" says Joshi. Plastic pollution and the resultant environmental degradation has led some startups in the city to focus on waste management. According to a 2015 study by the Central Pollution Control Board, Ahmedabad generated the most plastic waste after Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai and Bengaluru.


“One of the great initiatives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is the Swachh Bharat Mission. This has made people, government authorities and even leaders in the country realize that most Indian cities are actually sitting on a time bomb when it comes to waste generation.

“Scale attributes are important for investments in mid-tier companies. Key scale attributes are—pockets of differentiation and ability to win consistently against established players in core areas of competence, quality of employee base, profile of clients and breadth of offerings demonstrated through number of accounts that have accepted multiple services,"" Kotak’s analysts had said in an earlier note.

The money puts the BJP in an extraordinarily powerful position, even over logistical issues like how to get its leaders to election rallies


A Congress official said the BJP had the funds to reserve most of India's fleet of helicopters for hire for 90 days


MUMBAI/DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is flush with cash, giving his party a massive advantage over the main opposition Congress party as he seeks to win a second term in the general election.


Opaque campaign financing in the world's largest democracy makes it tricky to get a full picture of money in politics here. But current and former BJP supporters, opposition politicians, businessmen and activists interviewed by Reuters say Modi has an unprecedented advantage, thanks to support from businesses and expectations he will be the winner.


Staggered voting in the general election is currently in progress across India, with results to be declared on May 23.


The BJP war chest has allowed it to unleash a massive amount of advertising on social media and send Modi and party officials crisscrossing India to campaign.


The ruling party has showered money on Facebook and Google advertisements, spending six times more than Congress since February, according to data from the two firms. Modi merchandise abounds, as do Modi marketing sites.

Within a few hours, the South Korean smartphone maker will announce its flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy S10, along with a foldable smartphone and smart accessories including Galaxy Watch Active and Galaxy Buds. The launch event will take place at San Francisco at 12:30 am IST on 21 February.


This is the tenth anniversary of Samsung's Galaxy S-series and the launch is crucial for the chaebol as the global smartphone sales are plummeting.


The Galaxy S10 will have three variants—the regular S10, S10 Plus and S10e. The Galaxy S10e will be the more pocket-friendly version of the three and will skip on a few features, that might be a blessing in disguise.


Crucial details about the Samsung Galaxy S10 have already been brought to the surface. Samsung accidentally aired its flagship's commercial on a Norwegian TV channel TV 2. The commercial shows the smartphone in its full glory and confirms almost every speculation surrounding S10.


The 30-second commercial highlights the smartphone's new display with a punch hole to accommodate the front-facing cameras. It also shows the new ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner and the reverse wireless charging feature that appears to be borrowed straight off from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. It also confirms the presence of a 3.5mm headphone jack, which was rumoured to be skipped.",1

Ahead of the high-profile 12 May election, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal led-AAP and Rahul Gandhi-led Congress took a public posture in favour of an alliance.

"Understanding millennial views is important because of their growing numbers. Millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) and post-millennials (Gen Zers aged 18 to 22) are increasingly becoming the target-group of global marketers. Their growing numbers have not been lost on politicians either, with almost all political parties vying for their attention through social media campaigns targeted at the digitally-connected demographic group. Millennials and post-millennial adults together account for roughly half of India’s electorate, with an estimated population (based on census projections) of 459 millions in 2019.


The YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey was conducted online—among 5,038 respondents from YouGov India’s panel of internet users spread across more than 180 cities. 2,709 of the 5,038 respondents were millennials (with 1,489 younger millennials), 1,188 were from the Gen-Z (born after 1996). Among the rest 1,141, nearly three-fourths belonged to the Gen-X (born between 1965 and 1981) and the rest were even older.


The support for Modi and the BJP cuts across age-groups, with only a mild dip in support for the ruling regime among younger millennials. More respondents expressed support for regional parties than for the Congress, with 33 percent of older millennials and 38 percent of younger millennials supporting neither BJP nor Congress.


Given that the sample of Congress supporters is quite small across cohorts, the rest of the analysis will focus on BJP-leaning and non-BJP-leaning youth (including those aligned with Congress and other parties). In some cases, the data for millennials and post-millennials are clubbed together to ensure adequate sample size.",0

"The BJP’s prospects in the southern states, save Karnataka, will remain limited in Elections 2019, suggest data from previous polls


New Delhi: Traditionally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been perceived as a North Indian party, with limited influence beyond the Hindi-speaking states. While the party has done much to change this perception, notching up a host of victories in the country’s North-East, the South Indian states remain its Achilles heel. Even in 2014, when the BJP swept the Lok Sabha elections, it won a mere 21 seats in the five southern states, or 19% of the 112 seats on offer. By contrast, in the rest of the country, the BJP won 60% of seats on offer.


Not only has the number of southern seats won by the BJP remained constant, the party has also failed to expand beyond its traditional strongholds in Karnataka. A comparison between the 1998 and 2014 elections shows that the BJP’s victories are mostly confined to coastal and north Karnataka.


In 2014, the BJP, acknowledging its shortcomings in the southern states, competed only in 67 seats (out of 112). It secured a vote share of 31% across these seats and won in 21 (31% of contested seats). While this was lower than the BJP’s national performance where it secured 40% vote share and 66% seats in the seats it contested, it was still an improvement over the BJP’s previous performance in the South. In the 2009 elections when the BJP was more ambitious, competing in 106 seats, it won only 19 seats (18%). In the forthcoming elections, the BJP is expected to follow a targeted strategy, focusing on fewer constituencies, and relying on allies in other constituencies.",0

Trust us, say current and former US officials: Classified information they can’t discuss proves Huawei will purloin customer secrets any time it can. Out in the open, Huawei, after becoming the world’s largest telecom-equipment manufacturer, has elevated surveillance systems to be one of its “strategic business lines,’’ a phrase mentioned 23 times during an August event in Guangzhou, China, to release 30 new types of cameras, according to Jeffrey Ding of the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute.


Already in 230 cities – including many in China as well as in Mauritius, Serbia, Kenya and elsewhere – Huawei has installed what it calls its “Safe City’’ technology, which involves a network of cameras that can match faces and license plates to central databases.


Cybersecurity experts from both the Obama and Trump administrations agree on the risk. “These companies need to be considered as functional extensions of Chinese intelligence,"" says James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for President Barack Obama and is now a frequent Trump critic. “This is one case where I agree with this administration.""


The difference is what to do about it. Obama pursued diplomacy to rein in Chinese cyber-theft, signing a landmark agreement in 2015 in which the US and China agreed not to hack each other’s economic secrets. The Trump team scrapped the whole idea of engaging China and supporting its economic development as a means of moderating the country’s conduct. This administration’s approach, confrontation and containment, was outlined in Trump’s first “National Security Strategy,"" published in December 2017.


“For decades, US policy was rooted in the belief that support for China’s rise and for its integration into the post-war international order would liberalize China. Contrary to our hopes, China expanded its power at the expense of the sovereignty of others,"" the document declared. “We will work with our partners to contest China’s unfair trade and economic practices and restrict its acquisition of sensitive technologies.""


Huawei is the tip of the spear, the administration believes. In recent months, the US has dispatched lawyers, diplomats and intelligence officials to corporate and government offices around the world to press its case that Huawei must not be allowed to run their 5G networks. The technology’s next generation is expected to facilitate connections that are 10 to 100 times faster than current standards allow. Everything from grocery shelves to surgical robots to supertankers on the high seas will communicate instantly via antennas, facilitating automation on a transformative scale. Driverless cars will ping each other to avoid collisions as they whiz within centimeters of one another at high speeds. Factories, drones and mobile phones will coordinate home deliveries in an algorithmic chain without a single human being. Entire movies will download onto a laptop in seconds.


Digital networks will become even more integral in everyday life – and more susceptible to serious mischief. A malevolent state with control over an adversary’s 5G network could wreak mass industrial sabotage and social collapse, US officials say.


“This will be the first major deployment of internet technology which creates more risk than benefit if not properly controlled,"" according to a memo written by retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert Spalding, who served on Trump’s National Security Council when it issued the 2017 National Security Strategy.",1

"However, the odds are nearly insurmountable for the CPM. Wayanad consists of seven assembly segments and the CPM is in power in four of them. The CPM also controls four of the seven municipalities in the region. Out of 50 panchayats, the CPM is in power of 29. However, it is demarcated in such a way that there is more people in the consituency from Malappuram district than from Wayanad district because of population differences. And in Muslim-dominated Malappuram, the Indian Union Muslim League, an ally of Congress, is a major force to reckon with.


Resultantly, Wayanad has been indisputably a Congress bastion. After the constituency was carved out in 2009, the last elections were won by Congress’ M.A. Shanavas, who died in 2018. The saving grace for the Left is the thinning of victory margin for Shanavas, from 1.5 lakh votes in 2009 to just about 20,000 votes, or just 2.3% vote share difference, in 2014. But the local Left leaders agree that the 2014 result is more because of a personal setback for Shanavas, who was facing incumbency, coupled with a rise of votes for the BJP. The BJP raised its vote share from 3.85% in 2009 to 8.83%, resulting in some 80,000 votes, in 2014.

"In 2014, Gadkari rode the Modi wave to win by a huge margin (even though Narendra Modi did not campaign in the constituency then, and this time round). 2019 looks no different given that the Congress has been decimated in what was once its impenetrable citadel. All six members of legislative assembly (MLAs) in this Lok Sabha constituency are of the BJP. It has a two-thirds majority in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) whose roots date back to 1860s when it was founded as a municipal council.


There’s a caveat though. The BJP has won only twice from here: 1996, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee rode the Ram temple movement’s resurgence, and 2014, when Modi wave flattened the Congress. It has been a Congress citadel for its multi-cultural, multi-religious and muti-lingual character—people of this city remained loyal to the grand old party, until the Congress itself began to neglect Nagpur.


As an antidote to a bitter infighting within the local unit, the Congress has this time fielded Nana Patole, a former member of Parliament (MP) from Bhandara-Gondia who had resigned from the BJP last year to rejoin the grand old party. With just a week to go before the campaigning ends, Patole seems to be struggling to reach out to the masses. His close associates say, the city Congress isn’t helping a bit. On pure electoral merit and organizational strengths, Patole’s victory looks difficult, according to many local political pundits, given Gadkari’s clout and BJP apparatus. But Nagpur has thrown surprises before.


Nagpur defeated the scholarly Bapuji Aney way back in 1965 when he was seeking a re-election to steer the statehood movement; it drowned the Communist Party of India’s (CPI’s) Ardhendu Bhushan Bardhan before he packed up and left for New Delhi; Sumatitai Sukalikar, among the pre-eminent women leaders of the Sangh Parivar, could never win. The late Vasant Sathe or N.K.P. Salve never dared to contest from here, given the complex caste arithmetic. Nagpur did not spare Lata Mangeshkar. Long ago when she was at the pinnacle of her glory, she was hooted out by the crowds during an event, never mind that she vowed never to sing here again.


Of the 2.1 million plus voters, nearly 200,000 are the first-time voters. The Scheduled Castes, Muslims, Kunbis (or the dominant of the other backward classes) form nearly half the electorate. Last time, they overwhelmingly tilted towards the BJP, particularly Gadkari, disregarding their long anti-BJP or anti-RSS tilt.


While he begins as an overwhelming favourite, Gadkari’s re-election, despite his towering claims, is not a certainty due to a complex dynamics of Nagpur’s Lok Sabha constituency, says an independent political leader who is considered close to the BJP satrap. “Scheduled Castes and Muslims are unhappy and very quiet,"" he points out. “And Kunbis are waiting to hit back at the BJP, given that they are sidelined."" If all three of these major chunk of electorate vote strategically and decisively against the BJP, a study of several past election results indicate, Gadkari will struggle. A non-existent Congress won’t matter if the masses decide to vote en masse. Add to it a weavers’ community that is angry.


While the big ticket projects are a symbol of New Smart Nagpur, a growing middle-class aspiration, and a signature of Gadkari’s obsession with everything big, the city’s underbelly is full of problems. There is growing joblessness; growing desperation; huge in-migration; and big unorganized sector. “This (the metro) is good, but we need more opportunities here,"" chuckled a young Utkarsh Dandekar, an undergraduate from one of Nagpur’s pre-eminent educational institution, the Hislop College. He has brought his aunt for a joy ride. “Most of my friends will move out for jobs,"" he says, as he boards the metro.


There is a great divide: Nagpur has at least ₹65-70,000 crore worth of infrastructure projects in pipeline, but the city hasn’t been creating secure and well-paid jobs.


Patole, a former MLA from Sakoli who contested the 2014 election on a BJP ticket and won, before he locked horns with Modi and quit the BJP to return to the Congress fold, is a Kunbi. But of a sub-caste that does not exist in Nagpur. Plus, he does not have his own following in the city. What he has, though, is the strong support of the Congress’ central leadership. He has been picked up over a couple of local favourites.


Patole has a rural base. He was made the in-charge of the All India Kisan Congress for that reason. He now finds himself leading a battle in a transforming urban landscape. With less than ten days to go for polls, he lacks a strategy and issues to fight against Gadkari.


On the other hand, Gadkari commands popularity; has a carefully built image of a do-gooder, and has a silent campaign going in his favour that he is a prime ministerial candidate in case the BJP stops below 200 seats. In April 2014, before elections, Gadkari made two promises: one, he would strive for a separate statehood to Vidarbha; two, replace tar roads with cement roads that have long life. Nagpur trusted him. He defeated the seven-time Congress MP Vilas Muttemwar by a huge margin and consigned him to political irrelevance.


In early March, when he asked his workers and policemen to bash up the statehood supporters who shouted slogans against him at his public meeting in Nagpur, it was a complete contrast to his 2014 position. Cement roads are replacing every single arterial road; every service under the NMC has been privatized, and Nagpur is officially a smart city, but the promise of statehood and returning the city its state capital status has become a casualty. New migrants don’t have a stake in this issue. And both Gadkari and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis seem to have forgotten their love for an issue they rode on, until 2014.",0

This has also united warring factions across the south to take on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP.


The BJP has for long tried to use its strong base in Karnataka to expand its footprint in the south. It is a challenge in Tamil Nadu where it has only one MP in alliance with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which is strife-ridden and facing an anti-incumbency. The Congress has struck an alliance with the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.


The saffron outfit, which has no MP from Kerala, hopes to break ground in the state. The uproar over ending the ban on women’s entering the Sabarimala temple, apparently with the support of the ruling communists, created a groundswell of support for the BJP in Kerala. However, Kerala’s complex community and caste support for the two dominant political combinations, one led by the communists and the other by the Congress, and the BJP’s lack of popular local leaders to draw votes is likely to test its ability to win seats.


“It was a caste, communal agenda driven elections, one reason was the brouhaha over Sabarimala. Instead of public issues or governance issues, both the politicians and the public were talking about how to protect a religious law,"" said J. Prabhash, a political analystbased in Kerala.

"Jobs and infrastructure, understandably, are next on the list of priorities for the residents of this city, which was once an economic powerhouse but has slowly been losing out to other urban centres.


“That Ahmedabad, in its own unflashy way the first modern city created by Indians, could generate new productive wealth through its traditions of textile manufacturing and maintain its cultural character, were exactly the reasons that led Gandhi to adopt it as a home – and vital source of funds—for his new nationalist politics,"" Sunil Khilnani writes in his book The Idea of India.


In Ahmedabad, where the Sabarmati Ashram as well as the Kocharab Ashram are located, Gandhi found many wealthy textile barons who were his earliest supporters. The city was home to Gandhi from 1917 to 1930 and many of his ideas that shaped the freedom struggle took birth here.


Khilnani acknowledges that Ahmedabad began losing out to other Indian cities towards the end of the last century, primarily because of the closure of textile mills in the 1980s, which led to massive layoffs, lockouts and job losses.


Ahmedabad hasn’t seemed to be able to catch up since. In the early 2000s, when information technology (IT) outsourcing firms, including Infosys and Wipro, emerged as the largest job creators in the organized sector—most of them preferred to be based out of Bengaluru and Hyderabad.",0

"The Galaxy Fold has a 4.6-inch screen on the front, which makes it smaller than most modern smartphone screens. But it opens up to become a 7.3-inch tablet, letting users run three apps at once. It has half a terabyte of storage and 12 gigabytes of RAM, rivaling high-end laptops. It also has six cameras and a pair of batteries.


The device feels like a tablet when opened up. There’s a satisfying click sound for the hinge. A crease is noticeable, but it doesn’t get in the way of using it. There’s spacing between two sides of the touchscreen keyboard so that typing with thumbs is comfortable.


When folded shut, the front-facing screen is small, and there is a noticeable gap above and below the display. The phone is also fairly thick when closed.

The opposition Congress party, which is also spending sizable sums of money on social media ads, is trying to revive its past glory and turn around a declining voter base.


Tackling fake news is a huge challenge in India, a nation with 1.14 billion cellphone connections, the most Facebook users in the world at 300 million, and another 240 million users of the messaging service WhatsApp. In such an environment, fake news can spread faster than regulators can act.


Watchdogs say in the run-up to the vote they've seen everything from manipulated pictures being picked up by mainstream news media, to misrepresented quotes sparking communal division, false news and hateful propaganda. And it looks like people are buying it.


Indian internet users, many of whom are relatively new to the web, may lack the awareness of knowing that ""just because it's on a screen does not mean it's true,"" said Apar Gupta, who runs an advocacy group called the Internet Freedom Foundation.


India's problem with fake news isn't new, though, and it has already proven to have deadly consequences. In late 2018, at least 20 people were killed in mob attacks that were triggered by rumors on social media of strangers abducting children from villages.

But that wasn’t the only thing that changed. Several security and privacy features were added to the new version along with Digital Wellness, which is aimed at reducing the amount of time people spend on their smartphones.


While all of these trends are based on the majority of the smartphones that came out this year, there were certainly a few outliers like the Razer Phone 2 with a metal back, LED accent lights and a 120Hz display.

""Overall, the government presented an expansionary budget and prioritized populism over fiscal prudence (i.e., this is an election budget). The deviation from the FY19 fiscal deficit target and the “pause"" on FY20 fiscal consolidation is a negative surprise, relative to our expectations. The cumulative effect of the cash transfer to farmers and the middle income class will be a boost to consumption, but likely at the cost of crowding out private investments.

"WAYANAD: When 24 hunter-gatherers, part of an ancient tribe of 200, decided to trek 18km through the jungles down their home in the hills of Western Ghats in order to vote in the Lok Sabha elections in Wayanad on Tuesday, they unknowingly helped create a record in Kerala.


Near the end of the voting day at 6pm, the total turnout in Kerala was as high as 78%, according to provisional figures, beating its previous 2014 poll record of 73%. Wayanad too saw a record high turnout of 76.21%.

"The emergence and acceptance of the sharing economy, with companies like Airbnb, OyoRooms and BlaBlaCar, has struck a chord with enterprising and cost-conscious travellers. It has also created completely new dynamics on the supply side by helping monetization of personal assets and bringing unorganized budget hotels or lodges in the mainstream.


The journey of a traveller from search to discovery to booking to experience has been transformed to attend to his or her need of a seamless experience, adventure, personalization, instant gratification, and reliance on peer-to-peer feedback.


These travellers are growing. According to a report by World Tourism Organization, it is estimated that by 2030, people will take 1.8 billion international trips. In 2017, India generated about 24 million outbound trips , both business and leisure, which is going to increase significantly going forward. While this is the change we will witness in future, the disruptions are already underway.


Augmented reality is being used currently for language translation by pointing smartphone cameras at words, navigation, and routing. An example is the interactive metro maps for the New York subway.


Virtual reality is bringing destinations and accommodation closer to the traveller, allowing travellers to explore destinations that he or she can select and experience before making the booking. Some of these firms go as far as to use wind machines and olfactory stimulants to replicate not just the sights but also the smells and sounds.


Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the discovery and booking process—in the form of voice-enabled hotel search in Alexa through Kayak and reservation via booking.com, keyless digital entry in hotels, baggage tracking and notification, and seamless integration of your own devices with the inter-connected devices in hotel rooms.",1

We have already exposed some of his lies and we too have videos to play. His rallies will have little impact because he is a not player himself,"" Fadnavis added.


Mumbai-based veteran political commentator, Bhau Torsekar, said Raj Thackeray is exploiting the Lok Sabha campaign to revive his party for the assembly polls six months later. “I will not dismiss his campaign merely on the grounds that he is not contesting himself. Even Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray did that in 1980. In Maharashtra, the Congress-NCP lack a strong voice and the ability to take on Modi. Raj is filling that vacuum and taking the opposition space that would help him revive the party for the assembly polls. While the general impression is that his campaign is helping the Congress-NCP, I think in the long run, these two parties face the bigger threat from the MNS. In the short run, I don’t think Raj is going to damage the NDA much, and the huge crowds at his rallies won’t translate into any serious electoral swing against the NDA,"" Torsekar added.",0

New Delhi: Smartphone makers are in a perpetual race to attract photography enthusiasts by adding more cameras to their phones. It was HTC that started the trend way back in 2011 when it introduced the first dual-camera smartphone. Seven years later, Huawei launched its P20 Pro with three cameras. Now, Samsung has gone a step further with the new Galaxy A9, which comes with four cameras.


To be sure, more cameras do offer some tangible benefits and additional features, though they come at a price. Huawei’s P20 Pro, for instance, has a 40-megapixel (MP) camera with an RGB (red, green and blue) sensor, a 20MP camera with monochrome (black and white) sensor, and an 8MP camera with a 3x optical zoom lens. While this allows optical zoom on cameras, which is noticeably better than regular digital zoom functions, it also adds more detail.

"Each phase of digital transformation influences the society at numerous levels and has a specific set of social and economic impacts. On the social front, digitalisation strengthens the delivery of public services such as healthcare and education by improving the speed and scale of service delivery to the citizens.


In addition, digitalisation contributes to the overall development of society by providing financial inclusion and communication services. On the economic development front, it enables the automation of business processes, leading to operational efficiencies, such as reduction of manufacturing costs and higher productivity.


Digital transformation also open door to new business opportunities, thus creating employment. However, digital transformation can trigger societal impacts such as jobs displacement, talent shortage and cybersecurity concerns.

"The two heartland states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which send the maximum number of leaders to the Lok Sabha (120 in all), offer different electoral scenarios for the main stakeholders.


In Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 73 seats in 2014, party president Amit Shah has set a target of winning 74 this time, including one of the two Gandhi dynasty seats of Amethi and Raebareli. This is obviously easier desired than done because there are significant variables now.


The Samajwadi Party (SP)-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance has been sealed and there are efforts underway to bring the Congress on board. Even without the Congress, the SP-BSP alliance is a formidable proposition, given their collective might evidenced in the bypolls to Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats in 2018. The BJP suffered crushing defeats in those constituencies.


The Congress had a forgettable performance in 2014 but it could only improve now, possibly aided by the formal entry of Priyanka Gandhi as the AICC general secretary and in-charge of East Uttar Pradesh. Also, the BJP has not been able to bring on board smaller parties like Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party.


In Bihar though, the BJP was deft and accommodative to formalize its alliance with the Janata Dal (United), or JDU. The BJP settled for a fewer number of seats (17) than it won in 2014 (22) in Bihar. In contrast, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress have not been able to stitch together a pre-poll alliance.


Maharashtra, which sends 48 MPs to the Lok Sabha, promises to be more competitive in Elections 2019 than it was five years back. The NDA, which won 42 seats in 2014, has so far not made room for Ramdas Athavale’s Republican Party of India. While Athavale has a limited appeal among Dalits, his exit from NDA, if it happens, could mean bad optics for the BJP and Shiv Sena. This time, the Congress and the NCP, which have announced a pre-poll alliance but haven’t finalized seat-sharing, also seem to be a more concerted unit.",0

Apple is the only major player which does not manufacture phones in India and it only assembles two low-cost older models through Wistron Corp in Bengaluru.


Bengaluru: Software engineer Samee Alam was ready to take the big leap and buy an iPhone in this week’s Diwali festival sales, but at the last minute he opted for cheaper Chinese competitor OnePlus instead. Alam, 27, spends hours on his phone watching shows, surfing and shopping, making him the perfect target for Apple Inc as it strives to raise sales among India’s 1.3 billion consumers.


But in a country where the average per capita income is around $2,000 a year, even the cheapest of this year’s new iPhones, the XR at ₹ 76,900 ($1,058), costs twice as much as many of the alternatives.


Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research says that iPhone sales are falling as a result. From three million phones in 2017, sales may sink to two million this year, according to their estimate, the first decline in four years.


More than half of those sales will come from cheaper older models, and the lack of progress in India was among problems cited by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook when he gave a disappointing holiday outlook last week.

"In a theatrical style, powered with roadshows and winged by Priyanka Gandhi on his side, Congress scion Rahul Gandhi is expected to arrive in Wayanad on Wednesday, a day ahead of filing his nominations for the polls. Gandhi’s contest may have put the place on a national spotlight, but many here do not imagine him to understand their problems, let alone solve it.


“At the end of it, nobody seems to be interested in what to demand from politicians. For all we know, if Gandhi wins from both Wayanad and Amethi, he is going to leave Wayanad and there will be another election. So how is he going to help us? Why the fuss then,"" asked a young man, who did not want to be quoted, from Wayanad who has built several tents near a forest range with the idea of renting it out to tourists. Isolated, greeny, squeezed between the forests and the hilly parts of Western Ghats, Wayanad is one of the most beautiful places in Kerala. It is a place outside time and history. But the beauty of the foggy hills masks a third world wretchedness and backwardness which the young man thinks is not going to change with one election.


The usual progressive development indicators of Kerala takes a backseat in Wayanad. It has one of the lowest per capita incomes, lowest literacy rates, poorest infrastructure and medical facilities. Just to compare, the neighbouring Malabar region looks ages ahead. Back in 1956 when Kerala was formed, the Malabar lagged substantially behind the other two regions, Travancore and Cochin. But today, with appropriate state intervention and a windfall remittance money send by migrants leaving for West Asia through its airport every year, the differences have disappeared.",0
"TDP leaders from Andhra Pradesh also said that they had been avoiding mud-slinging on Telangana as a state, given that party chief N.

Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR),"" a senior TDP leader, who did not want to be identified, told Mint.


The TDP leader informed that his party was earlier contemplating to contest the Malkajgiri, Khammam and Secunderabad Lok Sabha seats (out of 17 seats), but decided against it at the last minute. “There are lakhs of settlers (people of Andhra origin) in those constituencies. And until now, we were not really talking ill about Telangana or the government because it would have been detrimental to our interests there. However, now we will do to KCR what he did to Naidu in the 2018 Telangana assembly elections by raking up the Telangana sentiment against him,"" he stated.


In the 2018 Telangana assembly elections (held in November), KCR had targeted Naidu constantly in his public meetings by asking people if they wanted “Andhra"" rulers again. The Congress, TDP, Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) had joined hands to take on the TRS. However, KCR had the last laugh as he led his party to a stunning victory by winning 88 of the 119 seats, while the Congress and TDP won just 19 (8 have since defected to the TRS) and two (one defected to TRS).",0

“Whether it is about security of the poor or the country, this chowkidar and NDA leadership is standing like a wall to protect them. The government is taking decisions to protect the poor, socially weaker sections and the middle class. The NDA government is trying to transform the lives of people,"" said Modi.


Describing the opposition’s mahagathbandhan against the NDA, as a maha milavat, or severely adulterated alliance, Modi said that when security forces were busy fighting against the threat of terrorism both inside and outside the country, some leaders yet again started questioning the veracity of the recently -conducted air strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

"Key issues likely to dominate the campaign are national security, rural distress, unemployment and the government’s social welfare policies.


In 2014, the BJP had won 282 seats, with a 31% vote share, and the Congress had won 44, with a 19.31% vote share.


The schedule for Elections 2019 marks a shift in the trend from previous national polls. While the number of phases has been reduced from nine previously, most states are witnessing more number of phases.


For instance, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal will have polling in all seven phases. This effectively means the states will go to the polls on each of the polling dates in the election schedule.


“A very tiny proportion of seats will go to polls. This will be problematic, especially in the earlier phases, because campaign will be on in the rest of the large proportion of the state. The purpose of the 48-hour no-campaign period gets beaten with a schedule like this,"" Kumar added.",0

"Camera: As far as flagship phones are concerned, the camera is the weakest aspect of the Galaxy S10 Plus. That doesn’t mean it has a poor camera. On the contrary, it will take some excellent shots for you, but Samsung’s algorithms are tuned to make every photo really bright. As a result, it often overexposes images or makes them look unnaturally bright.


Low-light images look really bright, which might look good against those taken by the newest iPhones, but fall short of the Pixel’s ability in this context. Both the front and rear cameras soften the details often, which shows especially when you’re clicking in indoor conditions, under fluorescent lighting.


That said, Samsung has three cameras on the back of this device – wide angle, telephoto and regular. These give you a lot of choice for how you want to shoot your photo. Samsung also has software tricks like filters, a night mode (that kicks in automatically if you’re shooting in areas with under 1 Lux of light and the Scene Optimizer feature is turned on), a mode that helps you frame your photos better etc.


Battery: With its 4100 mAh battery, the Galaxy S10 Plus can easily last a full work day. That means a charge every morning would get you through the work hours, but you might need a quick half an hour charge if you want it to last a full 24 hours.",1
"Modi -- or whoever wins power -- must use the mandate to fix the “plumbing"" of the financial system. The engines of loan growth in the world’s fastest-growing major economy are sputtering after a recent default at an infrastructure lender sent shock waves through the financial system, creating a crisis of confidence for shadow lenders. Further, state-run banks that comprise the bulk of the system are strapped with $190 billion of bad loans.


“In a well-run economy, smooth credit flow round the clock is a must,"" said Agrawal, whose firm’s stock has lost more than half its value since January 2018, as investor sentiment soured for non-bank finance companies. “It is the bare minimum.""


Modi is trying to secure a second term for his government this spring, five years after he won the largest mandate in three decades in 2014. His tenure has been a mix of big economic reforms including introducing a unified tax system for the country, insolvency and bankruptcy codes for companies and demonetization that struck at the heart of a largely cash-based economy.


The goods and services tax and the surprise decision to cancel high-value currency notes proved to be speed-breakers for economic growth, which led to a surge in unemployment.",3
"Well, Michael Yon took a number of photographs of helicopters in battle zones. He found that when landing or taking off, they often had what looked like gleaming halos above them, sometimes even two or three halos. With these rings of light glowing in the dust-laden dusk, complemented by landing lights in assorted other colours, the photographs are striking and strangely beautiful. Now “beautiful"" is not a word I thought I’d ever apply to helicopters, which are not quite the most graceful of aircraft. But take a look at several of Yon’s images on his blog post.


I also find those photos strangely moving, especially after reading Yon’s text that accompanies the images. At one point, a soldier, Captain Mark Hale, looked over Yon’s shoulder as he sifted through his helicopter halo shots to put together that post. “Mark had particularly liked the next three images,"" writes Yon, in which “the halos appear like distant galaxies (or) like the rings of Saturn"". Those are apt descriptions, as you’ll see on that page. And soon after, Captain Hale, as you’ll read on that page, was “killed while aiding a wounded soldier"".


Because the halos match the motion of the rotors—some helicopters have two or three rotors, so two or three halos —clearly the rotors produce the halos. But how? Yon asked the helicopter pilots, and their Command Sergeant Major Jeff Mellinger. This was their explanation:


“It is a result of static electricity created by friction as materials of dissimilar material strike against each other. In this case titanium/nickel blades moving through the air and dust...The most common time is when fuel is being pumped. When large tankers are being fuelled they must be grounded to prevent static electricity from discharging and creating explosions.""


Sounds reasonable enough. The dust does indeed have something to do with the phenomenon. Yon’s photographs are from his time with British and American troops in Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2009. When the helicopters land or take off, especially in the high-altitude deserts of that country, their rotors kick up a small storm of dust. There’s friction as the blades rotate through the dust.


But in an article in Nautilus in 2013 (Mystery in Motion, Beauty in Battle, 24 July 2013), the science writer Kyle Hill explained that this theory has problems, because “a static discharge looks nothing like a shower of sparks"".",1
"Access to medical records and simple prescriptions can prevent or treat most mundane illnesses remotely


MUMBAI: Dr. Devi Shetty, internationally renowned cardiac surgeon and chairman and founder of Narayana Health, starts his day much like everyone else. He checks his phone. Not for a dose of morning news or to catch up on a favourite celebrity’s latest. Dr. Shetty is wrapping up his morning intensive care unit (ICU) rounds, checking on hundreds of patients. For six months, Dr. Shetty has been conducting morning and night rounds of the ICU using a smartphone app, Kaizala.


Kaizala, a simple yet ingenious Microsoft app, is the WhatsApp of healthcare. Kaizala has its own messenger and a calling/video-calling facility in collaboration with Skype, but it does much more than a standard instant messaging app.


Patients and doctors, regardless of distance, can seamlessly exchange all kinds of medical data from patient history to test results, while complying with US standards of patient data protection.


From conducting ICU rounds on a WiFi-enabled flight to connecting thousands of patients to doctors, digital healthcare systems are eliminating hours of effort lost in setting up appointments, consultations and check-ups. This comfort offered by digitization is the first step towards transforming India’s healthcare system from a post facto system to a preventive one.


“Doctor-patient interface is required around once a year for chronic diseases, which are the leading cause of India’s health burden,"" says Dr. Shetty. Take diabetes, for instance: with 70 million diagnosed diabetics, 70 million pre-diabetics and merely 600 diabetologists in India, the supply gap is staggering. “In two to three years, when online diabetes care becomes reality, doctors will be in the pocket of every patient,"" says Dr. Shetty. “One diabetologist and five to 10 counsellors will be able to look after over 10,000 patients. Chronic diseases can be managed remotely as long as there is online trackability of medical data.""",1

"Apple on Wednesday unveiled the trio of successors to the iPhone X at its Gather Round event at Steve Jobs Theatre, Cupertino. Out of the three phones, the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max received dual-SIM support, a first for any Apple device ever. However, instead of having two physical SIM-card trays, the iPhone XS and XS Max come with one slot for a physical SIM card and an in-built eSIM or digital SIM module.


An eSIM, aka digital SIM and virtual SIM, is basically a SIM card that is embedded in the mobile device itself. You can think of it as a blank SIM card that can be changed to a carrier of your choice—without physically replacing the SIM card. The information on the eSIM can be rewritten by all compliant telecom operators over-the-air. This completely eliminates the need to buy a new physical SIM card while getting a new mobile number.


Earlier, Apple Watch Series 3 featured an eSIM and so did the Google Pixel 2 (but only in the US markets).",1
"Wife of late Kannada actor and senior Congress leader, H.Ambareesh, Sumalatha emulated her husband’s ‘rebel star’ title by taking the independent route after she was denied support by the Congress, which ceded the Mandya parliamentary seat to its alliance partner, Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) as part of its pre-poll agreement.


The Congress tried to dissuade Sumalatha from contesting in Mandya and even offered tickets from Bengaluru South, Bengaluru North parliamentary seats as well as entry into the legislative council.

"To the vast majority of users, however, the appreciable difference in speed and computing power between the iPhone Xs Max and the Note 9 will be negligible at best. It wouldn’t be wise to base a buying decision on this alone.


Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 starts at $1,000, while Apple’s iPhone Xs Max will cost $1,099. Higher memory storage capacity options will push these prices higher still. They’re expensive, and they’re powerful. They represent some of the most advanced developments in mobile computing and industrial design, and the differences between them are not going to be obvious to many casual shoppers.


But the iPhone’s thinner design, and Apple’s focus on refining its software, imaging system, and wider hardware ecosystem, may enhance its attraction to average consumers as well as some enterprise users. Samsung’s greater emphasis on pure productivity, with the inclusion of the S Pen stylus and connectivity to desktop monitors for a PC-like experience, may appeal more readily to power users.


With Samsung and Apple’s latest top-of-the-line gadgets representing the pinnacle of their respective expertise, the user experience will be comparable, and a buying decision could well just come down to: “Do you want a gold one with a notch in the screen, or a purple one with a stylus?""

"The BJP is likely to get seven-eight seats in Assam; one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Nagaland; two each in Tripura and Manipur


BJP’s Congress-mukt Bharat campaign has been loud in the North-East. The only minor setback till now has been the opposition in the face of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill


Until the Balakot air strikes gave a fillip to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagging popularity, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not exactly upbeat about its prospects in the 2019 general elections, especially after the assembly election setbacks in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. The BJP war room obviously had to work overtime to shore up support from as many states as possible, including the eight north-eastern states that account for 25 members of Parliament (MPs).


Assam, for instance, sends 14 MPs to the Lok Sabha. In 2014, the BJP won seven seats in Assam, which was then under the Congress rule. Now that Assam’s state legislature is under the BJP, the party hopes to get as many as 12 MPs in its kitty. Add to this number the seats that BJP allies hope to win from the other seven states in the North-East and the party believes the numbers would go up to something around 19-21 seats from the region. Securing that many seats could turn out to be crucial for the BJP.


The Congress-mukt Bharat campaign has been loud in the states that make up the North-East’s seven sisters—Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Tripura, Manipur, Mizoram and Assam. The only minor setback till now has been the strident opposition in the face of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 (CAB). But the BJP had made no bones about passing the Bill if it comes to power. That was the theme of its campaign in Assam in 2014. Hence, the CAB was no bolt from the blue. The irony is that when the CAB was pushed through in the Lok Sabha, it became a bone of contention. BJP’s allies like the National People’s Party (NPP) in Meghalaya, the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) in Nagaland, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in Assam, and the Naga People’s Front (NPF) and the NPP in Manipur started distancing themselves from the party.",0

The number is very limited right now, because of the restraint of infrastructure—we still do not have paved winding roads that are well-maintained, where these bikes can really perform. But we do see some new townships, hill stations and weekend getaways coming up near the metros, so people have started using performance two-wheelers.

Google claims that the photos taken with Super Res Zoom are equivalent to the output from smartphone cameras with 2x optical zoom. Similarly, to generate portrait shots with greater depth of field, it uses the dual pixel autofocus feature of the sensor, which captures two shots from the left and right and then merges them to create a perception of depth.

"Blockchain, primarily known for powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoins, is a form of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that promises to reduce costs and establish trust, but faces challenges like the speed of processing transactions. Its popularity lies in the fact that participants have a copy of the ledger’s data that contains the most recent transactions or changes, thus reducing the need to establish trust using traditional methods.


Blockchain is “pulling us into a new era of openness, decentralization and global inclusion"", states a June 2017 paper by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Large banking, financial services and insurance firms, manufacturing firms and governments across the world are already testing blockchain proofs of concept.


A blockchain network can either be public or private (permissioned), based on who is authorized to participate. One may like it to the difference between an intranet and the internet. Most pilots are being done with private blockchains.


In India, for instance, banks have formed ‘BankChain’—an alliance of banks formed in February 2017 to explore and build blockchain-based solutions. The BankChain community has 37 members, with representations from 28 Indian banks, including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd. Two years ago, for instance, the Mahindra Group and IBM announced the development of a cloud-based permissioned blockchain solution in a bid to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.


Blockchain technology can also disrupt public health by creating a secure and flexible ecosystem for exchanging electronic health records (EHRs). Student records, faculty records and educational certificates can be maintained with the application of blockchain technology. Other possible applications include the use of blockchain technology to record and manage agricultural land records as well as agriculture insurance. Blockchain technology can also be deployed to create a marketplace for electric power supply.


Have you ever wondered how your Smart TV can communicate with your Smart refrigerator and order food or drinks from your local grocer when it is empty? It is because of the IoT—a concept that allows various devices to communicate with each other with the help of embedded sensors.


The increased adoption is due to the availability of versatile low-cost sensors, improved infrastructure with ongoing deployment of 4G LTE, Wi-Fi and small cell networks and huge volumes of data. IoT is only expected to reach the tipping point with 5G networks.


The IoT market in India is expected to grow to $15 billion with 2.7 billion units by 2020, according to Nasscom. The global IoT market is expected to grow to over $3 trillion in the same period, driven both by consumer and industrial applications.

"West Bengal ruled by three-term chief minister Mamata Banerji was till recently considered impregnable for all political parties, leave alone the BJP. The feisty chief minister, not one to hold back punches or tricks, has systematically taken down all the opposition to the Trinamool Congress (TMC).


Similarly, Odisha is governed by Naveen Patnaik, a four-term chief minister and boss of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), who does not take any prisoners. Again, Patnaik has through a mix of astutely managed welfare programmes and by tapping the aura of his own father, Biju Patnaik, managed a similar stranglehold on electoral politics.


What then could possibly have changed? Both states are dissimilar. While religion and caste are big factors in West Bengal, neither serves as electoral currency in Odisha. Yet, the saffron party seems to be drawing traction in both states.


For one, both states are facing anti-incumbency; it also helps that the traditional opposition in both states is a pale shadow of itself, creating a perfect vacuum for the BJP to exploit. It is not that both states have not delivered on their welfare agenda; both leaders have ensured its success. The common thread seems to be rising aspirations and in the case of West Bengal, there is an added element of reaction against the perception that the Trinamool Congress has pursued an alleged minority appeasement agenda; this reverse polarization is exactly what the BJP had exploited in the 2017 general election in Uttar Pradesh.",0

"These companies are jostling for prime position to win the most lucrative pieces of the automotive data market: for example, delivering vehicle performance software, entertainment content and ads, while gathering up valuable user data. The closer a company is to the development phase of these standards, the greater chance of winning a slice of the pie.


A handful of mass-market carmakers, including Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp., are in the DSRC camp – perhaps unsurprisingly, given that they helped formulate the standard. VW has already invested significantly in the solution, and had planned to start putting it into cars this year. 


A powerful voice on the other side of the issue is the telecommunications industry, led by firms such as Deutsche Telekom AG and Vodafone Group Plc. The prize for skipping DSRC and going straight to 5G is the ability to participate in developing the new standards – and the potential to align them with carriers’ existing capabilities. Wireless operators are in a better position than carmakers to profit from the new technology, which can also talk to the broader cellular network, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Andrew Grant. Still, BMW AG and Daimler AG are among the luxury carmakers that are on their side. The 5G standards fit well with the C-V2X, or cellular vehicle-to-anything communications, already in use with top-of-the-range vehicles. 


If it were simply a question of superior technology, then they would surely reject the law. 5G promises rapid communication of large gobs of data, and can be used for more than just car safety.",1
"In a list of frequently asked questions about Alexa, Amazon says it uses mobile device location to provide more relevant answers and recommendations, and to enable features like reminders designed to trigger when a user reaches a certain place.


A second internal Amazon software tool, available to a smaller pool of workers who tag transcripts of voice recordings to help Alexa categorize requests, stores more personal data, according to one of the employees.


After punching in a customer ID number, those workers, called annotators and verifiers, can see the home and work addresses and phone numbers customers entered into the Alexa app when they set up the device, the employee said. If a user has chosen to share their contacts with Alexa, their names, numbers and email addresses also appear in the dashboard. That data is in the system so that if a customer says “Send a message to Laura,"" human reviewers can make sure transcribers wrote the name correctly so that the software learns to pair that request with the Laura in the contact list.


One employee said that, as recently as a year ago, an Amazon dashboard detailing a user’s contacts displayed full phone numbers. Now, in that same panel, some digits are obscured.


Amazon further limited access to data after Bloomberg’s April 10 report, two of the employees said.

"Mayawati, who was barred from campaigning for 48 hours starting Tuesday, pleaded against the sanction.


“These are drastic measures restraining them from holding public meetings. The EC has acted because of your order yesterday (Monday). The EC’s orders have been passed ex-parte,"" Mayawati’s lawyer Dushyant Dave argued.

The BSP supremo, in a statement issued outside the court, said the EC’s order marked a “black day"". She alleged that the decision was “hurried"" and taken “under pressure"".

"Oppo and Vivo were not just paying for Indian Premier League (IPL) advertisements and sponsoring the Indian cricket team, but also paying a lot of money to retailers who would put up their boards; give their products prime positioning; or sell their devices exclusively. “Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo give targets to distributors that are based on volumes. Instead, a brand like Samsung gives targets based on value,"" said a distributor based in Gurgaon.


This means retailers could make easy money from Chinese brands by showing the number of devices sold, while a brand like Samsung demands that they sell phones worth a particular amount. In a market that mostly buys cheaper phones, achieving value targets, like that of Samsung’s, are more difficult.


Mudit Sethia, who runs smartphone distribution and retail channels in Kishanganj, Bihar, said that some Chinese brands offer ₹ 150 per unit sold as an incentive. This could go up to above ₹ 200 per unit, depending on how expensive the phone in question is.


Furthermore, another source in Gurgaon said some distributors are wholesaling Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo’s phones to grey markets at nearly zero margins. This allows them to fulfill the volume targets that these Chinese brands want, hence earning the incentive they offer on those sales.


Selling to the grey market doesn’t just allow them to fulfill volumes—it also gives them a much wider coverage than their current stores and networks can offer.


He also said that distributors who were doing business worth ₹ 20 lakh per month by selling Xiaomi’s phones earlier have suddenly seen a sharp increase in business transactions—up to ₹ 4 crore per month just ahead of the festive season, thanks to this strategy. Another reason for this sharp increase is because of financing plans, which allow customers to get phones today and pay for them later.


The main reason behind the fall from grace for Indian brands, however, is the failure to gauge a fundamental shift in the market—when India suddenly moved from 3G to 4G in a matter of months and Reliance Jio changed the game completely. According to Vikas Jain, co-founder, Micromax Informatics Ltd, Micromax found itself with a huge stock of 3G smartphones across its supply chain, which it had to get rid of at a time when the market was focusing on 4G devices. “The total addressable market (TAM) went down,"" he said.


His inventory, which was meant for 60-75 days, was extended to 365 days. Singh agrees with this, saying that the Indian brands “had a lot of commitments"" in China for 3G phones, when Xiaomi and other brands were selling 4G devices.


Jain mentions that this was something that hit all Indian players, and since the market leaders could not fulfill the consumers’ demand for 4G-enabled devices, a huge gap was left to be filled. Their Chinese counterparts duly capitalised.


The Chinese firms were already coming from a 4G-dominant market and could bring their 4G-enabled phones to India. When Reliance Jio forced telecom players to adopt 4G connectivity and voice-over LTE (VoLTE) calling, Chinese phones were already ready for it.


While these brands also offered better pricing at times, Jain says that it alone cannot be the differentiator. “If I am able to do that (undercut somebody), then somebody should be able to do that to me too. Price is not the only mantra,"" he added.",1

"Mint asked top company bosses how they see disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and 5G impacting Indian firms


Mint asked top company bosses how they see disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and 5G impacting Indian firms. Edited excerpts:


Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.


The IT and digital transformation industry is witnessing exponential growth in the use of cutting-edge digital technologies like Blockchain, 5G, AI, automation, robotics, cybersecurity and IoT. One can expect all these new age technologies to make greater inroads both in the Indian and global markets, in the years ahead.


As part of our TechMNxt charter, we are collaborating and co-innovating with our partner ecosystem to derive business value for our customers by leveraging these digital technologies. 2019 can very well turn out to be an inflection point for many of these technologies converting into real connected experiences.


I believe if companies are pre-emptive in the data protection space, there will be a huge business opportunity for Indian IT players like Tech Mahindra, not just in the European markets but globally too.


At Tech Mahindra, we are bullish on 5G and as part of our preparedness for 5G, we are investing in 5G training labs in partnership with global players as well as setting up a training academy.


The government of India has been focusing heavily on developing India into a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025. The government’s focus on developing digital governance services and Smart Cities by adapting new age technologies like automation, AI, cybersecurity, blockchain and IoT has contributed to the growth of the Indian IT industry in recent times and promises to open additional avenues in the future.


While Indian enterprises are certainly susceptible to cyber threats, the scenario is gradually changing with organizations understanding the need of having a robust cyber security system. With increased focus on cybersecurity, major IT players like Tech Mahindra are also investing heavily in developing new age cyber security solutions.


Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.


The world has transitioned from an era of Industrial automation to Digital transformation and Industry 4.0. We are already witnessing the next stage with the emergence of Intelligent Enterprises. At SAP, we don’t look at technology in isolation. Instead we look at the outcomes it can enable when integrated seamlessly with data, people and processes.


Applications of technologies like AI are now impacting many sectors, blockchain is simplifying and optimizing erstwhile complex multi-party processes while IoT continues to push the boundaries of data exchange and consequent actions by machines and humans. As the application of these technologies mature, businesses across industries will adopt them to re-imagine their business processes.


Data is the new “oil"" in today’s digital economy, and companies are building larger reserves every single day. SAP believes there are effective alternatives to data localization, such as encryption technologies to ensure data security. We believe GDPR has paved the future of data privacy and provides a view of what compliance will look like moving forward.


Over the last three years, the programme has seen its share of success with a steady increase in internet and mobile users, as well as an increase in e-gov transactions. However, to achieve the goal of $1 trillion in GDP by 2025 (‘India’s tech opportunity’: McKinsey Global Institute), the government and India Inc., will need to come together to build a robust and nurturing ecosystem that not only provides citizens with technology, but with end-to-end solutions. This requires skill building of our large human capital at scale. With this in mind, SAP has launched initiatives like Code Unnati and Bharat ERP to build skills of young India along with an increase in industry capability to leverage them.


Digital transformation has impacted workplaces globally. The speed of innovation will continue to increase exponentially, and application of new-age technologies is making it possible to automate routine tasks. Not only are jobs changing, the job market itself is transforming.


We believe this technology has the potential to augment human potential and uplift the workforce into higher value adding jobs. To help elevate the country’s human capital to take on these roles, while promoting a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, SAP has signed a pact with NITI Aayog’s innovation unit to adopt 100 Atal Tinkering Labs. SAP believes people are the force behind innovation and growth.

"NSE in the past one year has made several representations to the regulator on relaxing the criteria and permitting higher number of stocks to trade in derivatives. According to NSE’s representations, a copy of which has been reviewed by Mint, single stock derivatives should be introduced on top 500 securities.

“Globally most markets allow derivatives contracts on single stocks without any restrictions. Both in the US and Europe more than 2000 securities have derivatives contracts.

Congress seen focusing on jobs, farm distress and Rafale deal to corner the Modi govt in the run-up to Elections 2019


New Delhi: On a recent tour of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Prime Minister Narendra Modi probably inadvertently (or purposely) gave away the possible election slogan “Modi Hai to Mumkin Hai"", when he highlighted his decisive action against terrorists in Pakistan after the Pulwama attack, besides other achievements of his government.


The slogan was repeated a number of times by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath at an event in Greater Noida on 9 March. Now that the election dates have been announced by the Election Commission, all government advertising, which had thus far used the tagline ""Namumkin Ab Mumkin Hai"", will cease.


“The Modi Namumkin-Mumkin report card blitz of the past weeks has got almost every ministry to do a recount of achievements and milestones. Tonnes of money has been spent on that entire effort, though technically it is a Government of India campaign and not the BJP’s (Bharatiya Janata Party’s). But Modi will now have to focus…choose one or two most important issues that may eventually swing the votes,"" said Sandeep Goyal, an advertising and media veteran.",0

“When US data starts converging with the rest of the world’s, if there’s a recovery in economic data elsewhere, then we’ll likely start to see the dollar weaken,"" said Simmons, who helps oversee the equivalent of $60 billion. “For now, Trump’s comments are having less of an influence.""",3

"Regulator further directed the NSE Ato prepare a detailed documented policy with respect to data usage and data sharing with external entities with due provisions for disclosures of conflict of interest to be made at the level of any employee of NSE.


The direction on disclosures of conflict of interest assumes significance after a massive breach of corporate governance norms was observed in the case in connection to noted public policy academician Ajay Shah for collusion to access confidential market information for business purposes.


Shah and his wife Susan Thomas are credited with co-creating the NSE Nifty50 index. He has had an illustrious stint at various high-level positions, including Ministry of Finance.

"According to analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, the lower visibility in the order book is due to the short-cycle nature of the business ABB India is now left with


Shares of ABB India Ltd, the local arm of Swedish multinational corporation ABB Group, have barely moved even after it reported impressive results for the December quarter. ABB India follows a January-December fiscal year.


In the period between October and December, the company’s revenue increased 15%, reflecting decent execution, while order inflows were up 17%, indicating that the growth momentum should continue. What’s more, with profit margins improving as well, operating profits jumped 48% from the year-ago period. The muted response of investors suggests that the high valuations of ABB India’s stock are a bit of a concern. Analysts peg its price-to-earnings valuation multiple at 38 times based on estimates for the year till December 2020. Revenue and margins also expanded in the last quarter.",3

"Bose is a case in point. Gaming laptops may have come a long way but they have still not found favour with the gaming community. PC makers are trying to change that perception with a new breed of gaming notebooks. Showcased at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas, these gaming laptops run on desktop-class hardware, are better equipped to handle heat and can be upgraded like desktops.


For instance, Dell’s Alienware Area-51m—a big-screen notebook that has a 17.3-inch display and a modular design. Then there is Asus’s ROG Mothership—a giant 2-in-1 laptop with a 17.3-inch 144Hz display with a metal kickstand for support and a detachable keyboard. Both run on slightly different variants of Intel’s core i9 CPU and Nvidia’s RTX 2080 GPU.


The highlight of the new gaming notebooks is that they use the same CPU and GPU that are used in gaming desktops and are socketed on the motherboard (makes upgrade possible), unlike the usual crop of gaming notebooks that use the mobile version of Intel’s CPU or Nvidia’s GPU, which are soldered (fixed) on the motherboard.",1

"A look at how Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, Internet of Things, 3-D printing and mixed realitya combination of Augmented Reality and Virtual Realityare transforming businesses


mint-india-wire long-reads TechnologyFuture of TechnologyArtificial IntelligenceBlockchainInternet of Things3D printingMixed RealityAugmented RealityVirtual Reality


Call it whatever you want—Digital Disruption or Digital Transformation—the fact remains that to stay relevant, organizations need to urgently reinvent their business models and growth strategies by putting digital first. They can do that with the help of newer technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and automation, blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), 3-D printing, and mixed reality that combines virtual reality and augmented reality. These technologies are not only disrupting and transforming business models and the lives of individuals, but also ushering in the so-called gig economy.


Almost two decades ago, the late Robin Williams starred in Bicentennial Man as an NDR-114 robot that was eventually declared a human by the courts. That remains science fiction. However, last October, Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics’ Sophia became the first AI-powered robot ever to get citizenship of a country—Saudi Arabia, even though Sophia pales in comparison to the humanoid in Bicentennial Man or those in Surrogates. Closer home, 38-year-old Ranchi-based Ranjit Srivastava has developed an Indian version of ‘Sophia’, christened Rashmi.


AI has no superpower, as yet. However, broadly defined as the desire to replicate human intelligence in machines, AI is undoubtedly becoming smarter with every passing day on the back of advancements in machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms, humongous amounts of Big Data on which these algorithms can be trained, and the phenomenal increase in computing power.


Such developments have, understandably, given rise to the fear that automation and AI will take away our jobs and eventually become more intelligent than human beings. A study by EY and Nasscom predict that by 2022, around 46% of the workforce will be engaged in entirely new jobs that do not exist today, or will be deployed in jobs that have radically-changed skill sets.


A 2017 survey by Statista finds that 78% of firms globally are either using AI extensively, or have plans for use in near future. However, adoption of AI in India has been slow and remains limited. Estimates indicate that only 22% of the firms in India use AI in any business process but things will improve now that the Indian government has woken up to AI’s potential.


AI is poised to disrupt our world and India, being the fastest-growing economy with the second-largest population in the world, has a significant stake in the AI revolution, NITI Aayog acknowledged in its June 2018 discussion paper titled ‘National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence’. Arguing that India has the potential to position itself among leaders on the global AI map “with a unique brand of #AIforAll"", NITI Aayog has decided to focus on five sectors: healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities and infrastructure, and smart mobility and transportation. This, even as it recognizes that the country lacks broad-based expertise in research and application of AI, and that there is a pressing need for privacy and security, including a lack of formal regulations around anonymization of data.

The influence of gender on youth attitudes is strong and clear. Fewer women, for instance, are interested in politics than men. In a graphic illustration of the power of patriarchy, large numbers of male and female youth concur that wives should remain obedient to their husbands and not work outside the house.


Class and caste inequalities have major consequences for the social experience of youth. For instance, economic compulsions push the lower class youth to find work and take on adult responsibilities earlier in their lives than the middle and upper class youth. With a high likelihood of pursuing higher education, the latter defer decisions on employment and marriage and experience a longer period of youth.


Illustrating the strong correlation between class and caste hierarchies, the CSDS-KAS survey reports that over two-fifths of upper caste youth identified themselves as students, whereas only about one-fourth of scheduled caste youth and a mere one-sixth of tribals did so.


Making available different kinds of livelihood challenges, the class and caste locations of the millennials make them respond differently towards socio-political issues.


Contrary to popular impression, therefore, a large proportion of Indian youth support either caste-based and/or class-based reservation in government jobs and educational institutions. Only 17% of the respondents opposed any form of reservation.


The millennials among religious and ethnic minorities and lower castes experience higher job insecurity and workplace discrimination. While a 10th of the upper caste youth declared that they were either professionals or government employees, only 5% of the backward caste, scheduled caste and Muslim youth shared that self-description. Some 9% of the scheduled caste youth are doing low paying unskilled work whereas the corresponding detail for the Muslim and backward caste youth is 5%. Further, more than half of the tribal youth pursue agriculture and allied activities.


Needless to add, the complexity of social differences eludes the binary of majority and minority communities. As per the CSDS-KAS survey, Muslim youth were largely in favour of abolishing death penalty while Christian and Sikh youth were least supportive. More than two-thirds of Muslim youth consider beef consumption a matter of personal choice, but only a third of the Hindu and Sikh youth shared that view. Among the Hindus, the vegetarians disapprove of beef consumption more than the non-vegetarians.",0

"Unsurprisingly, we find that leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have focused on the welfare achievements of their government. Across the board, BJP leaders highlight the work done in bringing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections, electricity and better constructed households to rural areas.

We find that some of these claims are true but others are either exaggerated or lack context. The government has improved rural infrastructure but this has not necessarily led to improvement in important outcomes.

Similarly, more households are now on the grid but many still do not get quality access to electricity.",0

"What was the need for the BJP to give ticket to terror accused Sadhvi Pragya Thakur? Though the Prime Minister has defended this decision, she seems to be on a spree to make controversial statements. Does the party regret this decision?


She has been given the ticket after the NIA said there was no evidence against her. It has turned out that the entire case against her was made up to serve a political narrative. If you recall, during 2007-08, there were many bomb blasts in many cities across India and many people from the Muslim community were being arrested in these cases. The Muslim sentiment was going against Congress-NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) and so they thought of building a counter-narrative by creating this bogey of Hindu terrorism which has been demolished. Giving ticket to Pragya Thakur is the answer to that bogus narrative of Hindu terrorism. Hindu terrorism does not exist. As for her statements, I and the party have already said that she should not have made that remark against Hemant Karkare even though she may have some personal experiences and anguish. She should be careful in public life. But then, there are seasoned politicians who make mistakes. She is a new entrant and she will learn to observe restraint.


In Maharashtra, it looks like Raj Thackeray is setting the agenda and the BJP is responding. Also, why do you think he has turned into a Modi-baiter from being a Modi supporter in 2014?


Not at all, in fact we are not responding at all. Whatever bare minimum response we are giving is because people should not accept his lies as truth. I don’t think he is going to have any impact anywhere in the state. Most of his claims that he has been making through those videos have been exposed as mere lies, like his claim that the National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met some Pakistani envoy just before the Pulwama attack. Actually, this meeting took place in 2017. Then, he said quoting some media report that no F-16 plane of Pakistan Air Force was shot down by India. But the Pentagon soon clarified that no such audit as claimed in the media report was carried out and our people also gave proof. Finally, one can quote anything out of context and we don’t need to respond to every lie. The only thing that has happened is that the Congress-NCP stand exposed. I think Raj Thackeray thought that the 2014 election ended his politics. Then he went to the Congress-NCP and is doing this to help them.

The metal, used in power and construction, has risen from an 18-month low of $5,736 in January on hopes that China, the largest consumer, can prevent a sharp economic downturn.

"Though what’s interesting is what “soon"" means here. In 1969, the USA’s Apollo 11 took about four days—launch to landing—to reach the moon. In 1970, the USSR’s Luna 17 landed there about a week after taking off. In 2013, China’s Chang’e 3 took five days to reach and settle into orbit around the moon, and landed a week later. Beresheet, by contrast, will only attempt to land on the moon on 11 April, nearly two months after blasting off. So while the moon is just over 350,000km away when it is closest to us, by the time Beresheet lands there, it will have travelled about 6.5 million km.


One reason for the long travel time is that Beresheet shared its ride into space with an Indonesian satellite and an experimental American craft. This is space exploration Uber Pool-style, then, which is also how SpaceIL’s co-founder Yonatan Winetraub described it just before the launch. The big advantage: it costs significantly less than a dedicated rocket would—and especially for a small private effort, price matters a great deal. The downside is that while a dedicated rocket might have set Beresheet directly on course for the moon, this Falcon 9 launch only put Beresheet into orbit around the earth, like it did the two ride-sharers.


What happens after that, so that Beresheet can take its shot at the moon, is up to SpaceIL’s engineers.


Yet mathematically, that’s a particularly interesting part of this exercise. For there are plenty of objects—the International Space Station (ISS), satellites and assorted space junk—that orbit the earth all the time. None of them are going to shoot for the moon.


What makes Beresheet different, even as it orbits the earth for several weeks? The difference is that Beresheet’s orbits will get steadily wider, and that’s entirely by design.


To understand this, think of something we’ve all done as kids—tie a stone to a string and whirl it around our heads. If you hold the string tight and keep up the whirling, the stone will keep going round and round indefinitely at the same speed. Though you’ll agree that you have to keep up the whirling; stop, and the stone will slow and drop down.",1
"That proposal faces resistance from The New York Times, The Washington Post and other publishers who believe Apple is trying to exploit its market power to extract excessive fees.


Most app makers, however, are too worried about losing access to the app stores to speak out against the fees. Epic Games, maker of the popular Fortnite video game, has been a notable exception.


Epic CEO Tim Sweeney lashed out at app fees as a ""parasitic loss "" at a video game conference 18 months ago, according to the trade publication GamesIndustry.biz. ""We should be angry about this, and we should constantly be on the lookout for other solutions, and new ways to reach gamers,"" Sweeney said at the time. The North Carolina company didn't respond to interview requests.


Since then, Epic has refused to release its Fortnite app in Google's Play store for Android phones, although it continues to offer an iPhone version. But Epic has opened its own app store for all video games built for personal computers, and only takes 12% of the revenue — a rate that Schachter fears Apple may eventually be pressured into adopting as well.


Sweeney broadcast a rallying cry for app maker on his Twitter account in January, not long after the news broke about Netflix abandoning Apple's subscription system.


A 30% commission ""completely breaks the economics of content distribution businesses like Netflix, Spotify, Kindle, and any digital stores that aim to compete,"" Sweeney tweeted . ""This has got to change in 2019!""",1

"Even though these technologies are fairly young and require much more research, they offer a window into the future of law enforcement. And it is a future where the emerging new concerns of privacy and the right to be left alone will co-exist with the reality of an increasingly monitored world.


Nano drones have begun to be deployed occasionally in every district in Uttar Pradesh to monitor law and order situation in areas with large crowds, points out SK Bhagat, IG, Lucknow range.


West Bengal police has also deployed drones for VIP security and monitoring large crowds during Durga Puja and Gangasagar Mela. Bengaluru-based Asteria Aerospace has been working with the police in Punjab, West Bengal, and Mumbai and is providing equipment and training to flying newly acquired drones.


“We have also integrated our software platform with the drones, which allows the police to monitor live video feeds from these drones at their command centre in Kolkata,"" says Neel Mehta, director and co-founder Asteria Aerospace.


For the Kumbh Mela, UP police has set up a control and command centre with 1,200 CCTV cameras watching over the entire area. They are using video analytics tool which will initiate alerts in case there is overcrowding at a particular zone or if people are moving in the wrong direction.


Police personnel on the ground will be using the Trinetra app to identify criminals. Delhi police has also used drones occasionally for monitoring and security.


According to news reports, three advanced drones have been deployed by UP police at the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj to capture photos and videos and send them to the temporary police control room set up for the Mela.


Also referred to as UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), drones are made of light composite materials to keep the weight in check so they could fly at higher altitudes. The basic ones with limited flying range use WiFi or radio frequency to connect and communicate with the pilot (via the controller) on the ground, while the advanced ones use GPS signals from satellites to pinpoint their location to the pilot. Using GPS, the pilot can also program a route allowing the drone to automatically fly to the destination and back to the take-off site by itself. When flying in autonomous mode, they can detect trees, buildings or other flying objects in the path and go around them automatically.",1
"Similarly, Lenovo’s new 300e 2-in-1 Chromebook runs on MediaTek’s inexpensive MTK 8173C chipset, originally designed for smartphones and tablets.


“As we move towards an ecosystem of connected devices, the need for a connected PC running on these mobile chipsets that offers LTE (long-term evolution or 4G) and superior battery life, along with steady performance for daily computing requirements looks to be a promising offering,"" says Nishant Bansal, research manager for PC and IPDS (imaging, printing and document solutions) at IDC India.


But can mobile chipsets match desktop-grade ones? Mobile chipsets are typically designed for smartphones, which is why efficiency and connectivity take precedence over computing power. They also use less power to avoid heating issues. On the other hand, desktop chipsets are meant for full-fledged computing and offer much higher clock speeds and system cache to store programme instructions and data that may be repeatedly required by the chipset.


Hence, to improve the user experience, Qualcomm is upping the ante with the Snapdragon 8cx chipset designed for PCs. It is the first 7nm chipset paired with faster Adreno 680 graphics, larger system cache and supports 4K (3,840x2,160p) HDR (high dynamic range) displays. It also includes the Snapdragon X24 LTE modem, which promises speeds of up to 2 Gbps.",1

A major advantage of having a screen on the back is that users can use the back cameras for capturing selfies. Front-facing cameras are usually fixed-focus ones, whereas rear cameras are more advanced.


The Nubia X from China’s Nubia Technology Co. Ltd has two screens with in-display fingerprint sensors built into both of them.


Both smartphones can also run two different sets of apps simultaneously on the two screens, letting users multitask without having to minimize any of them.

After the deaths of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, BJP and Congress have forged alliances with AIADMK and DMK for Elections 2019. But will these again be cases of 'bad friendship ending in disaster'?


Chennai: The results of forthcoming elections in Tamil Nadu will keep psephologists, political scientists, and historians busy for some years to come. Numbers will be crunched. The strength of various political parties will be weighed. Permutations and combinations will be worked out. But that is in the future. At this moment, however, it is a nightmare for political analysts and pollsters as they try to make predictions amidst a jumble of complex alliances.


The broad outlines of the alliances at least were a foregone conclusion. For all the outward wrangling, the major parties were clear about their partners. After the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-Congress falling out in 2014—M. Karunanidhi had bitterly said “kooda natpu kedai mudiyum (a bad friendship will only end in disaster)""—the Congress, in the last couple of years, has cozied up to the DMK. In 2014, as expected, the Congress had ignominiously lost in all seats, winning less than 5% of the votes. The only candidate to salvage some prestige, H. Vasanthakumar, is likely to give the lone sitting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of parliament (MP) from Tamil Nadu, union minister Pon Radhakrishnan, a run for his money if both were to face-off in the southernmost constituency of India, Kanniyakumari.


Karunanidhi chose his son M.K. Stalin, over daughter Kanimozhi and his other son M.K. Alagiri, as his political heir in Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).


Two months ago, DMK president M.K. Stalin jumped the gun when he declared Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s candidacy for India’s top position. Though moderation has characterized his later pronouncements, the DMK has surprisingly conceded 10 out of the state’s 40 Lok Sabha seats to the Congress—an indication less of the Congress’s ground strength and more of its chances to do a repeat of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) I & II (at least according to Stalin’s calculations).


On the other side, despite some hiccups—with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) MP and deputy speaker of the Lok Sabha M.Thambi Durai making frequent anti-BJP noises—the BJP was left with a Hobson’s choice: either ally with the ruling AIADMK or go alone.


Since J. Jayalalithaa’s death, the AIADMK has been little more than a puppet, the strings being pulled from Delhi being scarcely disguised. The revolt of O. Panneerselvam (OPS)—stopgap chief minister for three times—was contained, and a peace brokered between rival party factions. United by their fear of T.T.V. Dhinakaran, the jailed V.K.

"With both nations inching towards a trade deal that’s expected to include a provision for China to hold the yuan stable, US President Donald Trump is shifting his gaze to the dollar’s strength. During a largely unscripted two-hour speech on Saturday, he targeted Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell as someone who “likes raising rates"". Even though his treasury secretary sets currency policy, Trump pointed to Powell as a “gentleman that likes a very strong dollar"".


For China, a possible weaker dollar will lead to a stronger yuan, pressuring officials to halt its appreciation as the economy slows. That will risk triggering blunt criticism from Trump, who used his presidential election campaign to routinely accuse China of deliberately weakening its currency in order to boost exports.


'Trump wants the dollar to stay lower because of the impending election to counter the strengthening effects of his budget and Fed policy,"" said Douglas Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""But if you were to ask him why, he might offer the excuse of China’s currency.""


Keeping the yuan on a stable path won’t be easy given the slowing domestic economy and drawing on lessons from previous currency pacts such as the 1980s Plaza Accord, said Cliff Tan, MUFG Bank Ltd’s East Asia head of global markets research. ""We still think a weaker economy and credit problems should mean a weaker yuan later in the year,"" Tan said.",3

"“In some places it was like the panchayat elections. Those from the Congress voted for Congress and those from the JD(S) voted for the BJP,"" Gowda said in Mysuru on Wednesday.


Though he referred to a few pockets within his constituency, the statement coming at a time when distrust between the alliance partners appears to be at its peak indicates how the two traditional rivals have been unable and unwilling to overcome their bitter and violent past, especially between the workers on both sides.


The statement is likely to add to tension between former chief minister Siddaramaiah and JD(S) supremo and former prime minister H.D.Deve Gowda.


Siddaramaiah, in particular, had fought hard to retain his home district of Mysuru (and Kodagu) with the Congress despite the JD(S) trying equally hard to secure the constituency as part of the seat sharing agreement for the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.

Dhenkanal is also expected to witness a triangular fight.


In the four constituencies of lower Assam that will go to the polls on Tuesday, both the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front ((AIUDF) are seeking to gain votes by targeting the BJP over its stance in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.


The AIUDF has accused the Congress of not adhering to ""gentleman's agreement"" between the two parties under which the regional party did not put up candidates on 11 seats and was expecting the Congress to field ""weak candidates"". Congress, however, has said that it had no such arrangement.


The Congress will look to swell its tally in Kerala with Rahul Gandhi in the fray from Wayanad. The party had won 8 of the 20 seats in 2014 while a few more were won by its allies. The BJP too is seeing a realistic chance to win four seats in the southern state.


The Congress will also seek to at least retain the three seats it won in West Bengal in 2014, though it faces a multi-cornered challenge from the Trinamool Congress, the BJP and the CPI-M.

"Like multiple cameras, dual screen is another attempt by phone companies to create some buzz around their brands


NEW DELHI: Hot on the heels of foldable phones announced by Royole and Samsung, smartphone makers are pushing a new category—dual-screen phones. Unlike foldable screens which are made of a single giant screen that can be folded from the middle, dual-screen phones have two separate screens—on both the front and back panels (remember the Nokia Communicator?).


Smartphones like the YotaPhone and Meizu Pro 7 have attempted dual displays before. The YotaPhone used an LCD screen on the front and an E-ink display on the back. An E-ink display is the one used in Amazon’s Kindle e-readers. They are slower and cannot produce a full-colour image like LCD or AMOLED (an active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screen activates pixels faster) panels.


“What differentiates the latest attempts from the past, is that they have been able to improve upon the idea of a dual-display with their innovations, offering full-screen colour displays on the secondary screen,"" notes Prabhu Ram, head (industry intelligence group) at CyberMedia Research. A case in point is the Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition, which has a 6.4-inch full HD AMOLED screen on the front and 5.5-inch full HD AMOLED screen on the back. It is currently available in China at 4,998 yuan (around ₹52,490).",1
"According to the Socio Economic and Caste Census, 2011, Wayanad represents the highest number (79.67%) of rural households in Kerala where the main breadwinner earned less than ₹5,000 per month. It is followed by Malappuram at 75.55%. The average for India is 74.5% and for Kerala 70.75%.


In its list of 117 aspirational districts released last year, the NITI Aayog named Wayanad as the only district from Kerala that needed to catch up on socio-economic indicators—with the rest of Kerala, as well as the country.


According to the latest figures released by the NITI Aayog in February, Wayanad stands 14th out of 117 in the overall ranking, while in sub-indices, it ranks 48th in agriculture and water resources and 50th in basic infrastructure. It ranks 10th and 19th in health and education, respectively.


K.N. Harilal, professor at the Thiruvananthapuram-based Centre for Development Studies, said Wayanad is a case of relative backwardness. “While it is much ahead of many districts of the country, it is considered backward when compared to other districts of Kerala because of its high tribal population and fluctuating prices of plantation crops. It is one of the few districts to have seen farmer suicides.""",0

The FTC has not received complaints about ads on Google Assistant, according to results from a Freedom of Information Act request.

Google users have come to expect results from any relevant source on the web, except when using specialized tools like Google News or Google Flights that have a narrowed set of sources.


In 2017, Google Assistant adopted a specialty tool, Local Services, which offers only vetted businesses when U.S. users search for domestic help such as plumbers and locksmiths.


Results come from a marketing program, known as Google Guarantee, in which members are licensed, insured and clear of legal issues, according to Google. It refunds consumers up to $2,000 if members botch a job.

"Samsung’s Galaxy A9 sports a 24MP camera with an RGB sensor, a 10MP camera with a 2x optical zoom lens, an 8MP wide-angle camera with 120 degree field of view, and a 5MP camera to capture depth information. Phone makers augment the addition of such hardware with machine learning algorithms—often promoted as Artificial Intelligence-powered cameras—to produce better images.


Yet, while smartphone cameras have become better, and multiple sensors and lenses allow manufacturers to add features, do multiple cameras necessarily improve image quality over what dual cameras offered?


According to Wally Yang, senior marketing director (consumer business group) at Huawei, the addition of multiple cameras lets the camera process images differently. The Mate 20 Pro, he explains, can process subjects in real time and add black and white, and colour effects. Further, since the smartphone camera is about more than just taking pictures, adding additional sensors and lenses makes them future-ready. By using its multiple sensors, the Mate 20 Pro can create 3D models of things around you, says Wally.",1

"Samsung spent nearly five years working on the hinge, which went through more than 1,000 prototypes. It uses cogs and gears to give it a smooth feel and has two open positions. First, it unfolds to 140 degrees — handy if you want to put it down on your desk but still need to angle part of the screen for a video call, for example. Bend it further and the screen silently and solidly opens to a flat position. To close the phone, you click it out of the open position and snap the sides shut.


Fully open, there's plenty of real estate on the Galaxy Fold's main screen, which measures 7.3 inches (18.5 centimeters) diagonally. It's great if you want to take and review photos, watch videos or read e-books without squinting. Multi-tasking is also possible with up to three apps open at the same time. Wide open, the Fold felt more like a small tablet than a smartphone, which suggests that one possible market is people who want both kinds of devices but don't want to buy two.


As with anything that folds, there's a crease. It runs down the center of the screen and is visible at certain angles, though I didn't really notice it when using the apps. Samsung developed a new adhesive to glue the composite polymer screen together, and promises it can withstand being opened and closed 200,000 times, or 100 times a day for five years.


The Fold has a second screen, a long, narrow display, on one of its outer panels, so you can continue using apps while it's closed. I tried out a few — YouTube and car racing game ""Asphalt"" — that transitioned seamlessly between both screens. It could, for example, be useful to consult Google Maps in detail on the big screen before setting off, then put it in your pocket and quickly check the directions en route.

The second is Reliance Jio’s plans to float its tower infrastructure business into a separate entity. Analysts fear such a move can curb incremental tenancies from Jio.

The RBI also further relaxed the external commercial borrowing (ECB) norms for corporates wherein they can borrow up to $750 million through the automatic route, without the restriction of end use to repay existing rupee loans.


This has made analysts concerned that relaxation of ECB norms for corporates may expose them to currency risks going forward.",3

"Second, roughly half of his tweets since late-2017 have been either insults or confrontations. This period also overlapped with the highest jump in retweet rates for Rahul, and the data clearly suggests antagonistic tweeting has more reach. Finally, Rahul’s s anti-BJP message mostly focuses on corruption. This is distinct from Mamata, for instance, whose attacks on the BJP are relatively more about state rights and federalism.


On the BJP side, interestingly, both Amit Shah and Narendra Modi are far less likely to use confrontational language than the other three leaders. In no given quarter since early 2017 has Modi’s confrontational tweets been more than 10% of all tweets. The BJP’s online army of volunteers takes up a significant burden of the insult campaign, freeing up key leaders of the responsibility and offering plausible deniability.


But when Amit Shah does launch an online attack, it offers important insights into broader party strategy. In the run-up to the 2019 elections, the state leaders Shah has repeatedly attacked are Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Mamata Banerjee, not Akhilesh Yadav or Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati.


Insult and antagonistic exchanges have unfortunately become central to the electoral process. It does seem like Rahul Gandhi has picked up at least two important lessons from 2014: insults like “pappu"" have immense power and corruption is a saleable political issue. The “chowkidar chor hai"" campaign is an obvious byproduct of these lessons.


A pool of 8.4 million tweets since January 2019 from the accounts of 4,931 known politicians shows Congress attacks have heavily relied on the theme of corruption. The BJP, on the other hand, has made a decisive shift toward national security and cultural issues, a far cry from the “vikas"" discourse of 2014. On 23 May, we will know which approach worked.


Ultimately, social media will not dictate the outcome of the election. That said, the online narrative war is here to stay. The new government post 23 May will have a short honeymoon and many vocal critics.


The analysis in the charts is based on a samplof 19,954 tweets from the accounts of the top five politicians—Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Akhilesh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee. It includes every tweet since 1 January 2017.",0

The platform has been popular amongst enterprise and consumer users alike in the past. However, the emergence of simpler and more accessible platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and even Apple’s iMessage made it challenging for BBM to keep up.

The company brought BBM to other platforms in 2013, but some argue that it was too late by then.

"Reliance Power alleges ‘illegal and market disruptive activities’ by Edelweiss Group to cause a steep plunge in its share price


NEW DELHI: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Power has asked the Sebi to immediately ban Edelweiss Group from the capital market, alleging ""illegal and market disruptive activities"" to cause a steep plunge in the company's share price.


Reliance Group, last week, accused L&T Finance and Edelweiss Group entities of ""illegal"" and ""motivated"" actions in invoking the pledged shares of Anil Ambani group's three listed firms and selling them in open market causing a steep fall in share values.


L&T Finance and Edelweiss Group have refuted the allegations and have counter-alleged that Reliance Group failed to make timely payments, which they said necessitated sale of pledged shares.


Reliance Power, in a fresh letter to the Sebi dated February 11, also asked the markets regulator to declare all Edelweiss Group entities as not being ""fit and proper"" and impose a ban on each of them from the capital markets and related activities.",3

"Facebook's failure to safeguard that information allegedly violated D.C. consumer protection laws (AP)


Facebook employees knew the Cambridge Analytica had mined users’ personal data but didn’t tell those users


Facebook Inc. employees knew the Cambridge Analytica political-consulting firm had mined users’ personal data but didn’t tell those users before the news became public, an attorney for the District of Columbia said in court.


D.C. Assistant Deputy Attorney General Jimmy Rock made the claim while arguing against the social network’s bid to dismiss the district’s consumer protection lawsuit against it. The British consultancy used the data to target and influence voters on behalf of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign.


District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine sued Facebook in December, accusing it of allowing Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan to gain access to the personal information of some 70 million Americans, 340,000 of whom live in the capital. The company’s failure to safeguard that information allegedly violated D.C. consumer protection laws. The suit seeks a court order barring Facebook from continuing such practices, as well as unspecified monetary damages.


“Facebook believes that this case is not properly before this court,"" defense attorney Joshua Lipshutz told D.C. Superior Court Judge Fern Saddler on Friday afternoon, adding that if she reread the complaint, she would “search in vain"" for an allegation of company misconduct that would show the case belonged in her court.",1

"India is likely to witness an election campaign that is vicious, acerbic and represents the deep divisions clearly visible in society


With the formal announcement of Lok Sabha Elections 2019, the countdown to the national elections has truly begun. It is increasingly becoming clear that the coming election will be one of the most keenly contested, will witness a high-decibel campaign and be one of the shrillest in terms of rhetoric, attack and counterattack. One has already seen trends of this in the last few months. But, in what ways is Elections 2019 similar to the polls of the past, and from what perspective is it different?


In the five years since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, there has been an intense competition among different political parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was able to capitalize on its Lok Sabha victory and cash in on the goodwill for a few years. As it was coming close to completing its term, visible anti-incumbency stepped in, and the defeat in the Hindi heartland states at the end of last year appeared to have seen the political journey reach a ""full circle"". The Pulwama attack and the subsequent developments have added a new dimension to the ensuing electoral contest. In this context, a few issues merit attention.",0
"According to India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the mobile handset manufacturing in terms of value for 2018-19 is expected to touch a whopping ₹ 1.65 lakh crore with a volume turnover of about 29 crore units.


“The resurgent mobile handset manufacturing eco-system in India has saved the country of approximately ₹ 3 lakh crore through replacement of complete build unit imports and the growing domestic assembling or manufacturing of handsets,"" ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said.


He added that India’s mobile handset and components manufacturing industry has successfully established 268 manufacturing units, generating employment for over 6.7 lakh across the nation.


An ICEA-McKinsey report said if India extends its ambitions to the export market, it could manufacture around 1,250 million handsets by 2025 and create an industry worth around $230 billion. The onslaught of the Chinese giants like Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo continued during the year with these three players alone accounting for over 44 per cent of the shipment in the July-September quarter. Despite the intense competition, domestic players like Micromax and Lava remain upbeat. Lava International Head (Product) Tejinder Singh said brands engaged in short-term strategies in India would fail. “...brands like Lava, which have invested heavily in R&D will deliver products rich in quality and provide the best consumer experience to its customers. We feel that this cut throat competition is actually good for the industry as it pushes everyone to improve consistently, rethink strategies and optimise costs for the consumers,"" he explained.

"The crux of the administration’s argument is that Huawei couldn’t say no to demands from China’s government, even if it wanted to. China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires all Chinese companies and citizens to 'assist in and cooperate in national intelligence work' if requested. Whether Huawei or any of its employees have done so in the past is now incidental, China hawks argue, given Huawei’s lead in developing 5G technologies for the future.


“When people realized Huawei is effectively the only provider of 5G, they had to do something,’’ says James Mulvenon, a China specialist formerly with RAND Corp. who now works for defense contractor SOS International LLC of Reston, Virginia. 'Nobody is looking for a smoking gun anymore. They’re looking at the potentiality argument. If the [People’s Liberation Army] comes to them, they have no way of saying no.'


In his interview, Huawei CEO Ren said he would decline any request from Beijing for sensitive information on clients and stressed the potential for cooperation with the US and other countries on 5G and other matters. “Huawei firmly stands on the side of customers when it comes to cybersecurity and privacy,"" he said.


The executive order under consideration, for possible issuance in February, wouldn’t mention specific companies like Huawei and wouldn’t ban US sales by the firms, according to a person familiar with the matter. But it would empower the Commerce Department to review products and purchases by companies connected to adversarial countries, including China, this person said. A bipartisan bill recently introduced in Congress would take the more draconian step of banning sales of US parts to Huawei and its Chinese counterpart, ZTE Corp., which could drastically curtail their businesses. Another bill would set up a White House office to coordinate federal efforts to blunt technology threats from China.


The Trump administration is also stalking Huawei in other ways. Its most provocative act so far was asking Canada to arrest Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver last month on fraud charges linked to alleged Iran sanction violations, which Huawei denies. Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren, is out on bail awaiting possible extradition to the US. Her arrest “would never, never, ever have happened"" before the Trump pivot to confronting China, says Spalding, the retired Air Force general. “What you’re seeing is the beginning of a change in how the federal bureaucracy treats China.""


Elsewhere, US investigators in Seattle are looking into possible criminal charges against Huawei for alleged theft of trade secrets from US partner T-Mobile US Inc. The probe includes allegations that a Huawei engineer stole information when visiting a T-Mobile lab in Bellevue, Washington, to see a diagnostic robot called “Tappy"" that simulated a person’s phone use, according to one person familiar with the matter. In a 2014 lawsuit, T-Mobile alleged a Huawei engineer slipped one of the robot’s fingertips into his laptop bag during the visit and left with it. The jury sided with T-Mobile in 2017, saying T-Mobile should get $4.8 million in damages for breach of contract. The parties later agreed to drop the case after settlement talks.


China’s foreign ministry said on Jan. 17 that the legal dispute between Huawei and T-Mobile was resolved in court and expressed concern about the motives behind the “reinvestigation.""

"OPEC and its partners launched a new round of output cuts at the beginning of the year when it looked like booming US shale-oil production and fragile global demand growth would lead to a supply surplus. But as the group implements the curbs, and as supplies are squeezed further by crises in Venezuela and Iran, there’s now a greater risk of a shortage.


If the group continues with its cutbacks, global oil inventories will contract by almost 1 million barrels a day in the third quarter, the steepest drop in nearly two years, data from the organisation shows. However, the group won’t make a decision whether to extend until it meets in late June.


The strain on markets could go even deeper. A conflict is flaring in Libya, output is plunging in Venezuela because of a spiraling economic crisis, and the US will soon decide whether to tighten sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.

As mentioned earlier, Realme U1’s display is the same as the Realme 2 Pro—a 6.3-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 2340x1080. The dewdrop notch helps it stretch out the screen further to the bezels, but that doesn’t necessarily help with the viewing experience.


Although the display is sufficiently bright to use it outdoors, it lacks the contrast and vibrance you’d require to binge-watch Netflix. I watched three episodes of Narcos: Mexico and I couldn’t help but notice the poor reproduction of dimly lit scenes in the series.


Browsing through the web and fiddling around apps is fine, since the whites and touch sensitivity are both good. The notch also doesn’t come in the way and you get accustomed to it really quickly. The white balance seems to be on the cooler side, but it can be changed in the settings.

To let the AI flex more muscles, it also has a multi-core, multi-thread AI Processing Unit (APU) with a clock speed up to 525MHz.


This basically means AI and overall performance is upped a notch from the Helio P60, which was found on the Realme 1.


The chipset is unarguably one of the best in the price and definitely punches above its weight. While it’s given that the phone can tackle light to medium processes (like scrolling through your feed and having more than 7 apps open in the background) with ease, it can even fight through heavier processes like image editing and intensive gaming.

"With a surge of majoritarian nationalism following the terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pulwama and the air strikes in Pakistan by the Indian Air Force, pressing ground realities, be it the persistent fall in crop prices, stagnating rural wages and lack of jobs, have taken a back seat.


So when a farmer from Agra criticized the Yogi Adityanath-led state government for scuttling cattle trade and put forth his losses in the dairy business, he was jokingly booed—forcing him to leave in a hurry. His departure gave way to conversations which quickly turned communal.


The ground situation is in sharp contrast to how farmers held the Prime Minister accountable for depressed incomes and rising debts ahead of the state elections in December, which Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) lost in three agriculturally dominant states—Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.


Yet, there are those who are scathing. “Modi is giving ₹2,000 to farmers to do wah-wah (sing his praises),"" said Ram Prakash Yadav from Barabanki. “What help is ₹2,000 when I am selling milk at a loss every day?"" But Yadav’s is a lone voice: his son and neighbour sitting next to him felt Modi should return to power.


“The opposition has the arithmetic in its favour in Uttar Pradesh, but it has no narrative in place… opposition parties are yet to begin their campaign while people in villages are fed on a daily diet of nationalism and communal rhetoric,"" said a Lucknow-based political analyst who did not wish to be named. The reference is to the Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance which is hoping to pull down the Modi-led BJP’s tally in the state by consolidating scheduled caste, Yadav and Muslim votes.


In the 2014 general elections, the BJP won in a record 71 out of 80 Parliament seats in Uttar Pradesh, and a poor performance in 2019 can stall the re-election bid of Narendra Modi. In fact, at an all-India level the BJP won in an overwhelming 178 of the 342 rural Lok Sabha seats in 2014.


To repeat the 2014 performance, Modi will be banking on the support of farmers like 62-year-old Hanuman Prasad Yadav from Barabanki. Yadav is acutely aware of his fragile economic status. This season, a part of his potato harvest was destroyed. The fertilizer he buys now costs more. Diesel for irrigation and farm implements is a drain on his finances. Yet, he admits farm issues will not determine his vote. “Which previous government has worked for farmers? Modi is honest than others, he is not corrupt. Name one political leader who can match his stature… his government could have done better but how much can you expect one person to do?""

"1. The Yeti: If you have spent a long time walking around in the Himalayas, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has, you are certain to have heard of the Yeti. If you happened to wander a bit further than you should, you would have come across, or at least heard whispered, the Mi-Go—the Tibetan word for the Yeti. Unfortunately, there’s no Hindi or Sanskrit name for it. But the Indian Army now definitely knows it’s a “beast"". The trouble is no one knows what it looks like.

2. Dynasty: The long-running American prime time television serial, that is. There’s a reason it was long-running and prime time.

And since most village polling booths are government schools, you’d have fulfilled your de-development pledge anyway. See? No school!


4. Bed tea: Promise the voters (only those who vote for you, naturally) bed tea once a week.

"With the introduction of algorithmic ranking which prioritizes ‘engagement’, the right Facebook comment at the right time is the new gateway to mass attention on the internet. (AFP)


From Pakistani propaganda to countering politicians, comments on top Facebook pages are resetting the narrative


In February, following a terrorist attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers, and retaliatory air strikes by India on a terrorist training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot, the two nuclear-armed neighbours were on the brink of war.


As tensions heightened at the border, netizens of the two nations were fighting another war on Facebook. Pakistani users flooded the comment section of some of India’s most followed media pages: they called out journalists (“Itz now officiaL, US says no indian fighter jet has capability to hit F-16. And here in india its media and iaf keeps spreading fake propaganda against PAF.""); they challenged the claims made by Indian authorities (“BREAKING: Indian Jets dropped some massive tomatoes in Pakistan injuring 5 trees.""); they heaped praise on their Prime Minister Imran Khan and ridiculed India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi (“See the difference between the two national leaders An Oxford graduate And a tea seller."").


In volume terms, Indians outnumbered Pakistanis on these pages. But nationality is irrelevant for Facebook’s comment ranking algorithm: the counter-narrative offered by Pakistanis—“liked"" hundreds of times by their fellow countrymen—occupied the top position in the “most relevant"" comment display, Facebook’s ranking order where the “most engaging comments"" are shown first—often those “with the most likes and replies"".


Some Indians were visibly uncomfortable: one issued a warning to not be swayed by their posts (“There are lot of Pakistani guys who are commenting on our news posts and misguiding us constantly.. be careful!""); another wanted them to be blocked (“can you block these Pakistanis from commenting on this link My blood boils to see them commenting."").


But that’s not how the internet works. While news channels can decide whom they want to invite on their debates; newspaper journalists can choose the sources they interview; and politicians can do away with engagement altogether—such control is rarely visible on the comment section of Facebook. It is open to all.


And what gets said matters because while a top comment on a popular page may garner 2,000 “likes"", the average interaction (like, angry, love and sad, etc.) on a Times of India post is only about 120. With the introduction of algorithmic ranking which prioritizes “engagement"", the right Facebook comment at the right time on the right page is the new gateway to mass attention on the internet.


Mint reviewed the “most relevant"" comments on the 50 most commented posts shared over the last six months on 18 popular Indian Facebook pages (see graphic for the complete list).

"You have a considerable variety of textures, colours and materials when it comes to smartphone design at this price point.

The segment just north of ₹ 10,000 has been a tough one for many smartphone makers since a long, long time. Given the fact that mid-tier smartphone internals are punchier and more affordable than ever, the segment strikes the perfect balance among design, performance and value for money. But how much can a smartphone maker really squeeze into that price bracket? Let’s find out by comparing the three of the latest offerings by Xiaomi, Realme and Honor — Redmi 6 Pro, Realme 2 and Honor 9N.


Unlike the trend of 2017, smartphones in this price range no longer look alike — with a display covered by glass at the front and a metal unibody slapped at the back. Now you have considerable variety of textures, colours and materials when it comes to smartphone design at this price point.


Take Realme 2, for instance — wrapped in glass at the front and back, the phone feels nothing short of premium in hand. The metal frame sandwiched between also gives a reassuring feel to this device. Realme has been known for its “diamond cut"" design with its Realme 1 and the Realme 2 keeps that design aspect intact. Even the fingerprint scanner is placed at a slight angle at the back of the phone to reduce finger placement errors.


The Redmi 6 Pro on the other hand follows the traditional Xiaomi design philosophy of having a metal back and chassis. The phone feels sturdy and surprisingly small in hand but the all-metal design also adds considerable weight to the phone.


The Honor 9N also features a glass back, but comes in a single tone. The company claims it has 12 layers of premium glass with nano-coating. It is the lightest and shortest of all three phones in the shootout, which makes it the most holdable smartphone of the three.",1

"It’s been a while since a new social app got big enough, quickly enough, to make nonusers feel they’re missing out from an experience


Hello, person who is, statistically speaking, a human adult aged approximately “millennial"" to “boomer."" The analytics suggest a high likelihood that you’re aware there is an app named TikTok, and a similarly high likelihood that you’re not totally sure what it’s all about. Maybe you asked someone younger in your life, and they tried to explain and possibly failed. Or maybe you’ve heard that this new, extraordinarily popular video app is “a refreshing outlier in the social media universe"" that’s “genuinely fun to use."" Maybe you even tried it, but bounced straight out, confused and sapped.


“Fear of missing out"" is a common way to describe how social media can make people feel like everyone else is part of something — a concert, a secret beach, a brunch — that they’re not. A new wrinkle in this concept is that sometimes that “something"" is a social media platform itself. Maybe you saw a photo of some friends on Instagram at a great party and wondered why you weren’t there. But then, next in your feed, you saw a weird video, watermarked with a vibrating TikTok logo, scored with a song you’d never heard, starring a person you’d never seen. Maybe you saw one of the staggering number of ads for TikTok plastered throughout other social networks, and the real world, and wondered why you weren’t at that party, either, and why it seemed so far away.


It’s been a while since a new social app got big enough, quickly enough, to make nonusers feel they’re missing out from an experience. If we exclude “Fortnite,"" which is very social but also very much a game, the last time an app inspired such interest from people who weren’t on it was ... maybe Snapchat? (Not a coincidence that Snapchat’s audience skewed very young, too.)


And while you, perhaps an anxious abstainer, may feel perfectly secure in your “choice"" not to join that service, Snapchat has more daily users than Twitter, changed the course of its industry, and altered the way people communicate with their phones. TikTok, now reportedly 500 million users strong, is not so obvious in its intentions. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have them! Shall we?


TikTok is an app for making and sharing short videos. The videos are tall, not square, like on Snapchat or Instagram’s stories, but you navigate through videos by scrolling up and down, like a feed, not by tapping or swiping side to side.


Video creators have all sorts of tools at their disposal: filters as on Snapchat (and later, everyone else); the ability to search for sounds to score your video. Users are also strongly encouraged to engage with other users, through “response"" videos or by means of “duets"" — users can duplicate videos and add themselves alongside.


Hashtags play a surprisingly large role on TikTok. In more innocent times, Twitter hoped its users might congregate around hashtags in a never-ending series of productive pop-up mini-discourses. On TikTok, hashtags actually exist as a real, functional organizing principle: not for news, or even really anything trending anywhere else than TikTok, but for various “challenges,"" or jokes, or repeating formats, or other discernible blobs of activity.


TikTok is, however, a free-for-all. It’s easy to make a video on TikTok, not just because of the tools it gives users, but because of extensive reasons and prompts it provides for you. You can select from an enormous range of sounds, from popular song clips to short moments from TV shows, YouTube videos or other TikToks. You can join a dare-like challenge, or participate in a dance meme, or make a joke. Or you can make fun of all of these things.",1

"On April 29, 17 seats in Maharashtra including 6 in Mumbai go to polls. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also addressed the rally. Given the significant chunk of the urban middle-class voters in Mumbai, Modi made several strategic tweaks in his campaign speech. The better part of his speech was dedicated to development and the contribution of the “middle-class and honest tax-payers"" to the national economy and the welfare schemes for the poor. But he also mentioned other central themes in the 2019 BJP campaign like national security and a hard-line policy on terrorism and linked those to the future of an aspirational India which he said Mumbai symbolised.


Seeking to establish a connect between Mumbai’s aspirations and a stable government, Modi said the 2019 election was not about “garibi hatao promises"" but about commitment to provide “opportunities to the poor"". “Next five years present immense possibilities for India. We must not miss this opportunity. This election is about determining in which direction the nation wants to go,"" he said. Once again referring to the first-time voters who he said were born in the 21st century and looked ahead, Modi said the Congress party had lost connect with this generation. “Congress does not understand that this new voter has aspiration and dreams. Modi is only the expression of this new voter’s aspirations and dreams,"" he said.


Saying that the first three phases had already made it clear that the NDA was o course to getting a majority, Modi said the discussion in the country was whether the Congress would be able to reach the 50-seat mark or drop below 40. “All surveys say that the NDA is forming the government and the discussion is whether the NDA will get 300 or 325 or 400. All surveys, think tanks, political pundits also say that the Congress will barely reach 50 or drop below 40. Now, in this situation, it is only sensible that you vote for a party which is forming the next government. Don’t waste your vote by voting for a party which is struggling to get 40 seats,"" Modi said. He also pointed out that while the Congress tally in 2014 was the lowest in the history of Independent India, the oldest party was contesting the lowest number of seats since Independence in the current election.",0

"Besides the app fees, Apple's services division includes revenue from its Apple Music streaming service, iCloud storage, Apple Care, Apple Pay and ad commissions that Google pays to be the iPhone's built-in search engine. (Reuters)


Most app makers, however, are too worried about losing access to the app stores to speak out against the fees


San Francisco: Last year, every time someone paid $11 for Netflix through an iPhone app, Apple pocketed as much as $3.30. Multiply that by every charge made through iPhone apps and you can see why Netflix and other companies are fed up about what they consider Apple's unfair market power.


Late last year, Netflix rebelled against Apple's fees, which can range from 15% to 30%. Analysts fear other companies may follow. And attorneys representing consumers in a pending Supreme Court case charge that Apple is an unfair monopolist in the market for iPhone apps. An adverse decision in that case could open a legal door that might eventually force Apple to cut its generous commissions.


That could spell more bad news for Apple, which is already reeling from a slump in iPhone sales that has knocked down its shares by 25%. The company has been positioning its booming digital-services business as its new profit engine. That plan could hit a snag if the app store takes a hit, since it currently generates about a third of the company's services revenue.


Investors are now hanging onto Apple services as a ""life preserver in the choppy seas"" just as it's about to float away, Macquarie Securities analyst Benjamin Schachter concluded after the Netflix move.


These app-store fees mostly hit app developers themselves, although some pass along the costs to users of their iPhone apps. Spotify, for instance, used to tack $3 onto the cost of its $10-a-month paid service — but only for users who signed up via its iPhone or iPad app.",1

Why did you oppose the court's suggestion at that time. You had opposed at that time but yet we did it,"" the bench said.


It further said, ""No institution shall insulate itself from improvement, including judiciary. There is always a scope for improvement. Everyone needs improvement"".

"This narrative was, with the benefit of hindsight, seeded in the audacious win for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fashioned by Modi in 2014. It had ended the era of coalitions with the BJP, first time in 30 years, managing a majority on its own. The Modi stamp on the victory was not one off; we would see this pattern playing out again and again in every state election as the BJP expanded its national electoral footprint, at the expense of the Congress, to unprecedented proportions, with the exception of the defeats in Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.


Effectively, Modi has, over the last five years, emerged as the anchor of the BJP, which in turn has evolved into the principal pole of Indian politics. The flip side of this is that if Modi is weakened, so is the BJP, particularly with respect to the Lok Sabha elections.


It would ideally have avoided a presidential contest as it is aware that at present it does not have the leadership to challenge Modi. At the same time, its best bet has been to try and discredit Modi, which only reinforces the contours of a presidential contest.",0

”Q: Endgame shares some unexpected parallels with Game of Thrones, which also recently ran episodes about its heroes preparing for a significant battle and then the battle itself


 Why do you think these narratives are similar? Did you ever look at Game of Thrones for inspiration?Markus: We’re in a high-stakes time and a jarring time in history, where you have to contemplate what you’re willing to do to improve the situation


McFeely: Marvel has been accused of being the most expensive television show there is and there’s some truth to that


Markus: We occasionally wonder, did we just make the world’s most expensive inside-baseball fan service? But then we go, the fans are actually the majority of people who come to this


 How far apart can you keep these strands, and for how long, and still feel like you’re telling a single narrative? “Game of Thrones” has people who are just meeting now! As much as people think the culture’s going down the drain, there seems to be an elevating of people’s estimating of the kind of narrative that will succeed in popular culture


Q: Was the three-hour running time of Endgame ever in question?Markus: There was an agreement within the whole group that we’re going to take our time; we’re not going to cut a half-hour of it so we can get one more screening in per day

Q: And Tony Stark has to die as well?McFeely: Everyone knew this was going to be the end of Tony Stark


Q: And Cap was always going to be allowed his happy ending with Peggy Carter?McFeely: From the very first outline, we knew he was going to get his dance


 On a separate subject, I started to lose my barometer on what was just fan service and what was good for the character


Markus: A hero without sacrifice, you’re not going to get the miles out of that person that you need to for these movies


 Were we to take another one on, you can’t increase the scope or the stakes from where we are at the moment


Q: You’ve been writing these films and characters for more than a decade, and you never got bored of them —McFeely: Or fired


 They’d seen our process and us working with the (Russo) brothers, and they said, if Joss (Whedon) is not coming back — I don’t know that decision — it was clear that, unless they hated us, it was going to be this team

"The sophisticated nature of the attacks continues to baffle security experts. Kaspersky Labs recently uncovered a cyber espionage framework called Taj Mahal. Active since 2013, this APT (advanced persistent threat) framework appears to have no connection to any of the known threat actors, which could be the reason for the late detection.


What makes it a high risk threat is the presence of more than 80 modules for stealing information, such as audio recorders, keyloggers, screen and webcam grabbers, documents and cryptography key stealers. It can grab browser cookies, steal information from printer queues, capture previously seen files from a USB drive and gather backup lists from Apple iPhones. It is named after the file used to exfiltrate the stolen data. As of now, Taj Mahal has been used against a central Asian diplomatic entity in 2014.


It seems highly unlikely that such a huge investment would be undertaken for only one victim. This suggests that there are either further victims not yet identified, or additional versions of this malware in the wild, or possibly both. The distribution and infection vectors for the threat also remain unknown. Somehow, it has stayed under the radar for over five years.

Human-powered content labeling, also referred to as ""data annotation,"" is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.


Self-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc's Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI's ability to decipher speech.


Facebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.


After completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.


The company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.


The Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook's various messaging apps. The posts come from Facebook and Instagram users globally, in languages including English, Hindi and Arabic.


Each item goes to two labelers to check accuracy, and a third if they disagree, Facebook said. Workers said they see on average 700 items per day. Facebook said the target average is lower.",1

"User experience: Experts also feel there are some caveats from the user experience (UX) perspective. Both Galaxy Fold and Mate X seem to be using the same user interface as their single screen counterparts such as Galaxy S10. “The biggest UX consideration with foldable phones will be the screen ratio. It will be interesting to see how designers and developers handle the difference in screen ratio here. As of now, UX on foldable phones seems like a vague concept with no concrete answers,"" says Sufyan bin Uzayr, director at Parakozm, a software development and UI/UX design startup. For example, the aspect ratio of 4.2:3 in some foldable screen phones, is not in unison with the commonly used 16:9 and 18:9 ratio, which may result in wide spaces in some apps.


Weight: Experts also opine that foldable phones in their current form are too big and heavy for a smartphone and too small for a tablet they could use for work. A case in point is the Galaxy Fold, which reportedly weighs about 298gm. In comparison, single screen phones like Galaxy S10 plus, which has a 6.4-inch screen, weighs just 175gm. Pavel Naiya, senior analyst, devices and ecosystem at Counterpoint Research, cautions that larger display will also need a larger battery and this will also increase the thickness of the device.

As the West considers the threat posed by China’s naval ambitions, there is a natural tendency to place overarching attention on the South China Sea. This is understandable: Consolidating it would provide Beijing with a huge windfall of oil and natural gas, and a potential chokehold over up to 40% of the world’s shipping.


But this is only the most obvious manifestation of Chinese maritime strategy.

"While rural distress is a problem, we are also talking about smart villages. In the era of growing urbanization, even villagers look at themselves as urbanites. Earlier, people use to relish their rustic and rural identity. Now, people in rural areas have their eyes set on whatever is called ‘urban’. Not very long ago, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam talked about providing urban amenities. Why? Because rural people should not feel that they are disadvantaged. ‘Rural people do not want to remain rural’. Therefore, the manifesto has been drafted to ensure that urban amenities are taken to the doorstep of the rural people. We want to put an end to this disparity.


BJP has promised ₹25 trillion for rural development in next five years. Is it competitive populism by the party?


I do not think so. Populism comes into play when you indulge in reckless kite flying or when there is no track record to believe in you. There are many elements in the manifesto which can be described as very ambitious, but these ambitions are defensible. These emanate from an aspiring India and the mindset is rooted in the accomplishment of this government. Be it Ujjwala or Mudra, all these schemes have made lives of people comfortable.",0

The BJP returned to power in 1998 and in 1999 but lost the general elections in 2004.


Apart from voters, the key stakeholders in Ayodhya too are confident that the mediation panel, which is chaired by Supreme Court Justice (retd.) F.M.I.

The tea shop conversation winds down after half an hour with most participants agreeing that Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Smriti Irani is Gandhi’s strongest challenger


AMETHI: It is Friday morning and Arvind Panday (37) and Dev Prakash Mishra (35) share a bench under a tree near a tea shop. They also share a similar past—both belong to farmer families from Amethi district, both voted for the first time in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, and both supported Rahul Gandhi, who made his political debut that year. They’ve voted for Gandhi, now Congress president, in every general elections since. This election, however, they’ve diverged on their political views.


“My vote this time too will be for Rahul Gandhi,"" declares Mishra, sitting at the tea shop under the banyan tree in Musafirkhana, a town in Amethi district. “His family has done so much for this constituency. This is a crucial election and he needs our support more than ever. This constituency is not going any other way,"" says Mishra, who runs a small business.


Panday, beside him, politely disagrees: “Amethi is a VVIP constituency but what has it got? It is a civic mess. People are in the same situation they were 10 years ago. At some point, one needs to decide if we are electing an MP to improve a constituency or to help one family retain its political dominance."" Panday works for a security service in Lucknow and shuttles between the two towns.


Mishra and Panday voice the opinions you hear across the constituency, even the country, when politics is brought up. They also sum up the challenges the Gandhi-led Congress is facing in the ongoing Lok Sabha election—reaching out to those disillusioned by its past record, reversing its decline, and widening its support base beyond traditional party supporters.


The tea shop conversation winds down after half an hour with most participants agreeing that Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Smriti Irani is Gandhi’s strongest challenger—and the Amethi seat has never really seen a challenger, it being a Congress stronghold, since 1967. Amethi has sent a non-Congress member to Parliament only twice—in 1977 and to the short-lived 12th Lok Sabha in 1998. There is some disgruntlement about the lack of development in Amethi despite being a star constituency, but the debaters conclude that ‘larger sentiment’ could favour Gandhi one more time.",0

"The cameras are AI enabled, so they’ll be able to do the regular “smart"" stuff that other smartphones do like taking portrait photos, detection scenes automatically and so on. But a few interesting additions include “Portrait Colour Video"", “Portrait Video"" and AR videos. The cameras take full use of AI capabilities of the Kirin 980 processor (coming to that in a bit) and take the features that were restricted to only photography functions to videos. The Portrait Colour Video picks one colour in the frame and keeps the rest monochrome while the portrait video defocuses the background, much like the portrait photos. AR videos are similar to what is available on the Google Pixel 3 and 3XL—you have AR stickers that can be placed in videos and viewed real-time.


Coming to the one thing that’s common between the two phones—the processor. Both phones run Huawei’s in-house Kirin 980 processor, which implies Huawei was not stingy while picking processors for both devices. The Kirin 980 is the world’s first processor to be made on a 7nm processor, ensuring better performance and efficiency. Better performance is now mapped in terms of AI capabilities, and it stands up to that. The processor integrates better modems that allow it to attain 4.5G speeds of 1.4Gbps and WiFi speeds of 1,733Mbps—both of which are the fastest according to Huawei.


The processor is mated with either 6GB or 4GB of RAM on the Mate 20 and 8GB on the Mate 20 Pro. 128GB is the only storage option on the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro. The phone also comes with a “Nano-Memory Card"", which occupies the space of a nanoSIM card, with a capacity up to 256GB. So the hybrid SIM card tray can accommodate either a nanoSIM card or a Nano Memory Card apart from the primary NanoSIM.

"Third, organizations could consider investing in advanced security techniques such as threat-hunting and deception technologies, which baits hackers into attacking decoy servers, thereby enabling security professionals to analyse the motives of the threat-actors, all the while protecting real data assets.


Do board members set aside time to review critical cybersecurity controls, emerging risks and breach-preparedness? Do they seek external inputs to validate management’s cybersecurity assertions? Does the organization’s CISO report directly to the CEO or COO to encourage independence? Are employees, customers and third-parties regularly educated and audited to ensure they are fulfilling their cybersecurity responsibilities?


Organizations often benchmark the maturity of their security practices against sector-agnostic standards such as NIST and ISO27001, as well as sector-specific standards such as HITRUST for healthcare and PCI-DSS for online retailing. However, such compliance-driven approaches do not guarantee cyber resilience. Strengthening one’s security posture also requires the sharing of threat intelligence and anonymized attack data among peers—much like hackers who actively collaborate and share system vulnerabilities.

They were built largely by the US and its allies, ensuring that (from a Western perspective, at least) they were “cleanly"" installed without built-in espionage capability available to our opponents. US internet giants including Google, Facebook and Amazon are leasing or buying vast stretches of cables from the mostly private consortia of telecom operators that constructed them.


But now the Chinese conglomerate Huawei Technologies, the leading firm working to deliver 5G telephony networks globally, has gone to sea.

"The free-wheeling Silicon Valley model once seemed unquestionably the best approach, with stars from Google to Facebook to vouch for its superiority


A swathe of the world is adopting China’s vision for a tightly controlled internet over the unfettered American approach, a stunning ideological coup for Beijing that would have been unthinkable less than a decade ago.


Vietnam and Thailand are among the Southeast Asian nations warming to a governance model that twins sweeping content curbs with uncompromising data controls -- because it helps preserve the regime in power. A growing number of the region’s increasingly autocratic governments watched enviously the emergence of Chinese corporate titans from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- in spite of draconian online curbs. And now they want the same.


The more free-wheeling Silicon Valley model once seemed unquestionably the best approach, with stars from Google to Facebook to vouch for its superiority. Now, a re-molding of the internet into a tightly controlled and scrubbed sphere in China’s image is taking place from Russia to India. Yet it’s Southeast Asia that’s the economic and geopolitical linchpin to Chinese ambitions and where U.S.-Chinese tensions will come to a head: a region home to more than half a billion people whose internet economy is expected to triple to $240 billion by 2025.


“For authoritarian countries in general, the idea of the state being able to wall off to some extent its internet is deeply appealing,"" said Howard French, author of “Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China’s Push for Global Power. “This is about the regimes’ survival in an authoritarian situation. So that’s why they like to do this. They want to be able to insulate themselves against shocks.""",1

The Walabot Home is a smart home device that monitors people at home, without using regular camera technology. According to the company, the device uses low-power radio wave technology (similar to Wi-Fi) to monitor movements in your home. As a result, the Walabot Home can detect falls, something that will help caregivers take better care of senior citizens. The device also allows two-way calling and can make calls to emergency contacts automatically.

The tracker can be traced remotely from your smartphone, hence letting you find things you may have lost. The Seekit isn’t necessarily a device aimed at senior citizens, but if your parents lose their keys too often, this may be a great gadget for them to use. It has a range of 100 feet and works with both Android and iOS devices. It is water resistant and comes in two variants—the Seekit Edge and Seekit Loop.",1

There was, however, a bigger character who played a much larger role in reshaping Kashmir, especially the south: Burhan Wani. After the new-age militant’s death in July 2016, Kashmir caught fire, especially south Kashmir. For the next three months, Kashmir did only one thing—counting corpses, managing burials and ensuring the hospitals had the emergency basics. An anger that was brewing in the south over the ‘North pole, South pole’, as Mufti would describe BJP-PDP alliance, got an outlet.


By the time a semblance of normalcy returned, more than 100 civilians, mostly below the age of 25, had been killed. Of them, 59 belonged to south Kashmir. For the first time, the hunter shotguns were used for crowd control. Official statistics put the number of injured at 9,042, mostly by pellets, and 5,407 of them were from the south Kashmir region. Of 782 persons hit by pellets in their eyes, 390 were from this area. Some of them went blind.


Mehbooba’s effigies were burnt in 2016. The feeling of betrayal is the predominant narrative three years later. Her frequent uncharitable remarks added insult to injury. Last week, many voters said that their motivation to come out and vote was just to “teach her a lesson"".


Though the erstwhile crowd puller literally wept publicly at two places, residents are unwilling to forget her “toffee"" remark. In August, at the peak of 2016 unrest, with home minister Rajnath Singh on her side, Ms Mufti had famously reacted angrily to a reporter: “Had a kid gone to buy a toffee from an army camp? A 15-year-old boy who attacked a police station, had he gone to buy milk?""


During the unrest itself, all the garrisons that had been withdrawn were reopened, and the situation got back to like in the 1990s. This took the anger and hate against the PDP to the next level.


The law normally takes its own course. In the follow up to 2016 unrest, police registered 3,773 cases across Kashmir—1,254 in south Kashmir—for damage to public property during and after the unrest. Of the 11,290 arrests, 4,998 took place in this region. Youth listed in police records have to go through the mill of law enforcement. This process is a punishment in itself, where many individuals evolve from suspects to stone pelters and eventually to militants.",0

"But how will it work? This is where facial recognition tech kicks in. On their first travel, passengers will have to go to a registration kiosk at the airport to validate their ID. The passenger’s photo will be added to the Digi Yatra ID at this stage. At the entry point, or e-gate, passengers will scan their boarding pass or e-ticket. On scanning the QR code, the system will validate the passenger and flight details. The Digi Yatra ID will verify the passenger’s identity through facial recognition. Once these details are verified, the e-gate will open. The system will also generate a token that will combine the passenger’s photo with the ticket PNR. This token can then be used to pass through other security checks right up till the passenger boards the flight.


One of the biggest benefits of this system will be the fact that passengers will not need to show their boarding pass or ID at multiple check points. Both airport operators and the airlines will also have real-time information about the passenger’s location in the airport.

"Given the interplay of all these factors, it is difficult to make predictions, but possible to develop scenarios. Our analysis suggests that in India the growth in demand for work, barring extreme scenarios, could more than offset the number of jobs lost to automation. On jobs lost, we find that some 9% of India’s current work activity hours could be automated by 2030 in a “midpoint"" automation adoption scenario, and up to 19% in the “rapid"" adoption scenario. But, India can, in fact, create enough new jobs to offset automation and employ new entrants, if it undertakes the investments required. Most occupational categories have the potential to grow as India’s economy expands. As many as 100 million new jobs could be created for Indians—net of automation—if the country’s rising prosperity creates demand for construction, retail, and healthcare and education services, and therefore, jobs.


So, which job categories have most potential to grow? Our estimates suggest potential for substantial net job growth in all sectors barring agriculture. The blockbuster occupations of the future for India, based on our estimates, include:


Builders: India could see demand for an incremental 60 million workers in building and construction activities by 2030, assuming higher rates of investment in infrastructure, and residential and commercial construction. This means more jobs for architects, surveyors, engineers, electricians, carpenters, plumbers and construction labourers.


Customer interaction and creatives: Demand for retail salespeople, food preparers and handlers, artists, designers, entertainers, and similar categories of workers engaged in consumer interactions and activities, could rise by 23 million by 2030, as higher incomes create more consumption, with people shopping, travelling, eating out, and engaging in recreational activities.


Care providers: The future could see an explosion of demand for workers in healthcare services, to the tune of 13 million workers by 2030 in India. This is driven partly by global aging: spending on hospital care for an 85-year-old American is more than five times higher than for those 19 to 44 years old. Shifting demographics could create incremental demand for 51 million to 83 million workers globally such as home health aides, personal care aides, and nursing assistants. Much of the new demand will come from aging economies, such as Japan, China, or Germany, but India could export a trained healthcare workforce and will also face rising demand for their own healthcare needs.",1

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah, Congress president Rahul Gandhi and a host of Union ministers among others canvassed for their party candidates in the past few days, undertaking whirlwind tours of constituencies.


Among the key contestants in the fray are BJP chief Amit Shah (Gandhinagar, Gujarat), Congress president Rahul Gandhi (Wayanad, Kerala), and Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav (Mainpuri, UP).


During campaigning in Gujarat, the two principal parties -- the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress -- exchanged acrimonious barbs, with leaders from both groups exuding confidence of a good showing. The BJP had swept all 26 seats in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.


In Maharashtra, the prominent seats in the third phase include Jalna, where state BJP president Raosaheb Danveis in the fray against Vilas Autade of the Congress, and Baramati, where Supriya Sule, the daughter of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, is contesting against BJP's Kanchan Kul.",0

Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were the two key states which helped script history for Modi in 2014. Bihar is a high-stakes election for the BJP because within a year of being voted to power at the centre, the party had lost assembly elections in the state. Bihar is a prestige fight for the BJP-led NDA.


“Opposition parties in Bihar have lost credibility because of the leadership of Rashtriya Janata Dal. NDA has managed to create a perception that its leadership is stronger and people also relate to this narrative because of the work done by chief minister Nitish Kumar and the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" said Shashi Sharma, a Patna-based political analyst and principal of Magadh Mahila College.",0

"Voters stand in queue at a polling station during the third phase of general election at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala on Tuesday. (ANI)


Bengaluru: It was an unusual scene in Kerala on Tuesday as voters were lining up in front of several polling booths until late night to cast votes, despite problems ranging from rains to sweltering sun to finding a snake in a voting machine in Kannur to the machines itself turning faulty in many pockets. In some corners of Vadakara, people had to stand as long as seven hours, local reports said.


But despite such odds, Kerala had its highest voter turnout in recent history on Tuesday, thanks to the enthusiasm of voters across districts, especially women voters, to come out and mark their choices, no matter how long they had to wait.


According to the final polling figures issued by the Chief Electoral Officer, Kerala's turnout, from 2.62 crore total voters, stood at 77.68%, narrowly higher than the 77.35% recorded during the 2016 State Assembly Elections, and substantially higher than the 74.02% recorded in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections.

"It is all about Modi again and I would say this election is 100% about the Modi factor. In many constituencies, people are voting more for Modiji than the local candidates.


Is the Modi factor also working for you in constituencies where there is an obvious local anti-incumbency against the NDA candidates?


I think it is working everywhere for us including that one odd constituency you may have where there could be some local anti-incumbency. The Modi factor will overcome that local anti-incumbency and you will see that reflected in the results everywhere including Maharashtra. The local anti-incumbency will not matter because of Modiji.


If you say that Modi is very popular and this government has performed well, why then is the election narrative more about nationalism and less about developmental issues and performance?


No, I think our campaign has both the narratives, development and nationalism. In fact, if you look at Modiji’s speech in Nandurbar (on 22 April), he spoke for 20 minutes of which 15 were about development, what has been done for the tribals, and five minutes about nationalism. And nationalism is bound to come in the campaign narrative. Because there is a patriotic sentiment among people in the country. And more importantly, if the manifesto that the Congress party has come up with says that they will reduce the presence of Army in Kashmir, that there will be a rethink on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and Section 124 (A) on sedition will be dropped, nationalism will naturally come into the narrative. If one of the parties in their gathbandhan says that they want a separate prime minister in Kashmir and that India should have two prime ministers, why won’t the issue of nationalism come up? And what’s wrong in having nationalism as the narrative in the campaign? Name a country which does not have the issue of nationalism in its national election. Look at the US, Germany... nationalism is a major issue there in national elections.",0

"So far, so conventional. That opinion in Lucknow could vary widely under well-woven views, began to come across only in relatively relaxed settings.


It was trisyllabic, the city’s typical response to who would win this year’s elections: “BJP"".

Of course, he’d vote for the BJP. For its “policies"", he clarified.


Ah. And what did Kumar make of the SP-BSP alliance? There’s too much “jaativaad"" around, he sighed, “casteism""; and then went on to credit former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav with the Metro and several other public projects, most of which had been halted, he noted angrily, pointing to a river outside the window that should’ve got cleaned up by now. His litany might have carried on had my Vishwavidyalaya stop not arrived. The campus would surely have random folk to chat up.


A middle-ager at a snacks counter near one of the University’s gates was in favour of badlaav (change), a tack he seemed to reverse as soon as his name was asked. “Our vote is with Rajnathji,"" is all Ram Sahay would say thereafter.


Especially guarded in betraying any trace of discontent was Jagdamba Pal, 51, a grade IV employee sprawled on a cricket field. He was on a break from work and clear that votes had to be cast in secrecy. Who ruled the country made no difference to his life, he said, but Modi had to be its leader. Once satisfied with my not being a spy for some khufiya (secret) agency, though, he had a few questions to raise. Why, for example, had campus polls not been held for so long? Was the voice of India’s youth being heard?


As if to compensate, a double room at Subhas Chandra Bose Hostel was soon to work up a lively clamour of millennial voices. Choices would go by the credentials of candidates, said Kuldeep Shukla, 21. His forecast? The “Modi wave"" of 2014 was in decline and the anti-BJP alliance would get a larger number of seats in the state. “See, Modi did a lot,"" chimed in Manish Pathak, 22, “but other MPs (members of Parliament) and MLAs (members of legislative assembly) have let the party down."" Cited in support of this point were allegations of money being made by many of them on degree colleges and “duniya bhar ka vyaapaar (a lot of business)"", all sorts of business.


By now, word had spread down the corridor for other students to join in. For Manmohan Mishra, 21, the media was to blame for the sordid state of affairs: It was busy asking for answers on mango preferences instead of the Unnao rape case and other scandals. “Doesn’t the media know how to do an interview?"" he demanded. So volubly had he leapt into the room that an eruption of assorted protests—against some news channel or the other daily—were quelled for my benefit.

Experts believe that by replacing Patasani, BJD might have managed the anti-incumbency in the capital city. Arup Patnaik is seen as an able administrator because of his IPS experience as a top cop of Mumbai and provides a good contest to Sarangi whose name was announced as BJP candidate earlier this month.

"The Redmi Note series has been a trendsetter in many ways. Phones like the Redmi Note 3 and Redmi Note 4 were the first to change the public perception not just about Xiaomi but Chinese smartphones in general.


Four years later, the Redmi Note 7 Pro continues in the same vein, but overcoming some of the limitations of the series like the design and camera.


While the initial all-metal design in the Redmi Note 3 was a sensation, over the years the design of new Redmi phones skirted around similar lines. That changes with the Redmi Note 7 series. It has a flat glass back design with no rough edges, lending it a suave and shiny appearance that feels more like a high-end smartphone.


The thin bezels and teardrop shaped cutout has allowed Xiaomi to keep the phone's size in check. In terms of thickness (75.2mm), it is narrow enough to fit into small hands. However, it doesn't feel very reassuring to hold. In addition to the glossiness on the back, the rounded edges have a glossy finish too and that affects the grip quality a bit. At 186g, the Note 7 Pro feels prettysubstantial and weighs more than the likes of Samsung Galaxy M30 (174g).


The issue of grip quality can be resolved with a transparent silicone case or plastic case. Xiaomi is bundling a soft transparent case with the phone.",1

The Galaxy Fold’s screen imperfection develops on a protective film covering the touch sensor bonded with the display underneath, the person said. That’s one reason why Samsung kept the phone inside a glass case at MWC in Barcelona last month, the person said.

MUMBAI: Providing a grand finale to the National Democratic Alliance’s election campaign in Maharashtra ahead of the fourth phase on April 29, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sought to dovetail development with the interests of the middle-class and a hard-line policy on terrorism. Addressing a massive rally of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena-Republican Party of India Mahayuti here at the BKC ground, Modi reminded Mumbai of the long phase of terror attacks before 2014 and the “Congress policy of merely changing the home minister and chief minister"". “We have ended this culture of changing the home minister and chief minister after terror attack. We have started attacking the terrorists in their own territories,"" Modi said. He added that none of those standing in the “long queue for the post of prime ministers"" had the capability to root out terrorism.


“Before 2014, each time there was a terror attack in Mumbai, the Mumbaikars lifted themselves and demonstrated their Mumbai spirit. But they were hurt and angry too. And they asked this question—how long are we going to tolerate this,"" Modi said. He added that his government had responded to that question by launching a counter-attack on terror.",0

"Facebook confirmed labelers in Timisoara, Romania and Manila, the Philippines are involved in the same project.


Among Facebook's other labeling projects, one worker in Hyderabad for outsourcing vendor Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp said he and at least 500 colleagues look for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos.


The aim is to train an automated Facebook tool that enables advertisers to avoid sponsoring videos that are, for example, adult or political, Facebook said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.


Another application of labeling involved the social network's Marketplace shopping feature, where it automated category recommendations for new listings by first having labelers and product experts categorize some existing listings, Facebook's Mathur said.


At Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user's friends. That ensures the sample reflects the range of activity on Facebook and Instagram, said Karen Courington, director of product support operations at Facebook.


""We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys,"" the policy states.


Europe's GDPR also requires companies delete user data upon request. Facebook said it has technology to routinely sync labeled posts with both deletion requests and changes to content privacy settings.


Facebook and other companies are testing techniques to curtail the need for outsourced labeling, in part to analyze more data faster and cheaper. For instance, AI training data for news feed rankings and photo descriptions for the blind came from hashtags on Instagram posts, Facebook's Mathur said.",1

Seventeen seats in Maharashtra go to polls on 29 April in the fourth and last phase of general elections in the state that sends 48 members of Parliament (MPs) to the Lok Sabha. After Uttar Pradesh that sends 80, Maharashtra is the second most important state for the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Congress-led UPA (United Progressive Alliance).

Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to be a big factor in this election, there does not seem to be the 2014 kind of euphoria for Modi in this election. How would you analyse this?


See, if you compare the polling percentages of 2014 with the phases held so far in this election, you will see that there is hardly any significant difference. What does this mean? It means that if there was a high percentage of polling during the 2014 Modi wave and the same levels are being nearly maintained this time, there has to be something that is causing high level of polling this time. What is the difference this time? The difference is in 2014, since there was a huge wave among the middle-class, you could feel the euphoria because that is the vocal class. Now, the middle-class is already there, they are voting for Modiji and the wave this time is more powerful among the people in the lower strata of the society. The Modi wave this time is more powerful among the poor. But the poor are not as vocal as the middle-class, they do not show their euphoria the way the middle-class does, they are not part of any pre-poll survey or exit polls but this time, the Modi wave is led by these people and we can sense it. It is a silent wave and is more powerful than the 2014 wave. If you go ask the woman in the field or the common man on the street, they would say Modi.",0

"Smartphones have undoubtedly displaced point-and-shoot cameras. But they have some distance to cover before they dislodge digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras used by professional photographers.

He adds multiple sensors and lenses allow regular users to use various features that would otherwise be limited to the DSLR segment, though without providing the same levels of detail. Moreover, while smartphones may satisfy a user’s needs these days, for professional photography, there are still—and most likely will be for a long time—physical barriers which can’t be simply bypassed, according Marius Eschweiler, global director of business development at Leica Camera AG. “It all comes down to light and how efficiently a device can capture it, like their small sensor compact camera counter parts—which they’ve almost completely replaced—smartphones hit these barriers, too,"" he adds.


Meanwhile, technological developments are promising to help phone makers bundle additional cameras in smartphones, or even multiple lenses in cameras. Computational photography, for instance, allows smartphones to augment the lack of space and DSLR-class sensors with software. Researchers at Columbia University, New York, have experimented with high resolution sensors on smartphones, and surmised that computational photography could, theoretically, overcome the space constraints in smartphones (nyti.ms/2DR2f4f).",1

London: From photos to personal posts and private messages, social media users leave a long digital trail behind them.


With about one in three people worldwide estimated to have a social media account, the question has become more pressing for legal experts and was brought to the fore last week by the family of a deceased teenage girl in Britain.


The parents of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old who committed suicide in 2017, told local media they had been unable to access data on her phone, including her Instagram account, which they said might hold clues to why she took her own life.


""It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property,"" Russell's father, Ian, told the BBC.


""She died without a will, she was 14 and everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents and so should her data.""


The Facebook-owned social media giant said it is against its policies for someone to log into another person's account, but it would consider legitimate requests for family members to access information, provided there is a court order.


Britain is among the majority of countries in having no laws on digital inheritance, which makes such cases complicated, said Edina Harbinja, a senior lecturer in media and privacy law at Birmingham's Aston University.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released its election manifesto on Monday, with a central focus on its promise to empower the poor, double farm incomes in the next three years and continue to show zero tolerance to corruption and terrorism.


Releasing the manifesto at the BJP party office in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it would approach last-mile delivery on a mission mode to transform India into a developed country by 2047—the 100th anniversary of independence.


Both in terms of form and substance, the BJP manifesto has undergone a makeover. Unlike in 2014, this time the manifesto and the campaign have been developed around Modi—noticeably missing on the dais were the party veterans, including Murli Manohar Joshi, who had authored the previous manifesto. Particular care has also been taken to address key political challenges such as agrarian distress—something that contributed to the party’s defeat in the last round of assembly elections in December—and calibrating the ambitions of transforming India.",0
"While Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha (BJP) is seeking re-election from Hazaribag, former chief minister and BJP candidate Arjun Munda is taking on Kalicharan Munda of the Congress in the Khunti constituency.


This will be the second phase of polling in Madhya Pradesh, the first phase having been held on April 29. These seven constituencies -- Tikamgarh, Damoh, Khajuraho, Satna, Rewa, Hoshangabad and Betul -- were won by the BJP in 2014.


The Congress, which came to power in the state in December last year after 15 years, hopes to carry forward the winning momentum while the BJP hopes to repeat its 2014 showing.


Former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti is pitted against state Congress president G A Mir in the Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency where polling is being held in three phases due to security reasons.

"When asked what change they would like to see in 2019, greater safety for women ranked as the top answer for both BJP-leaning youth (27%) and non-BJP-leaning youth (27%). The second big change young voters desire is greater government accountability and less corruption. About 20% of BJP-leaning youth and 15% of non-BJP-leaning youth voted for greater accountability in the survey.


A reduction in religious and caste conflicts was the second big priority for non-BJP leaning youth (19%) and the fourth big priority for BJP-leaning youth (14%). Reducing income inequality was the third big priority for BJP-leaning youth (18%) and the fourth big priority for non-BJP-leaning youth (10%).


The results of the survey suggest that there is widespread support for an interventionist state in the country, with the youth more supportive of such a role.


Among the older generations (Gen X and beyond), 40% of those surveyed said that the government had no business in running a business. Among millennials, only a little over a third agreed with such a view. Among post-millennials, only a little over a quarter agreed with such a view.


An overwhelming majority of millennials and post-millennials cutting across the political divide want governments to run businesses in strategic sectors such as defence and to create more jobs in the public sector. On both these issues, their support for an activist state is higher than in the case of the older generations.",0

""Developers that abuse our enterprise certificates are in violation of the Apple Developer Enterprise Program Agreement and will have their certificates terminated, and if appropriate, they will be removed from our Developer Program completely,"" an Apple spokesperson told Reuters. ""We are continuously evaluating the cases of misuse and are prepared to take immediate action.""

"Yet there’s an imbalance at the heart of the alliance. Saudi Arabia needs its oil to sell for $95 a barrel to cover government spending this year in an economy that relies almost entirely on petroleum. Russia is more resilient, with a more diversified industrial base and a less bloated state that means it based its 2019 budget on $40 crude.


Since the OPEC production cuts entered their third year -- having originally been slated to last for six months -- Moscow has shown less enthusiasm. It’s drawn criticism from Saudi Arabia for making slow progress toward its output target. By March 12, Russian producers had implemented half their pledged cuts, giving them just a couple of weeks to go the rest of the way.


Russia said it will take a wait and see approach on whether to extend the OPEC deal because the market has achieved a fragile balance, Novak said in an interview with Bloomberg television on Sunday.

"Voters queue up at various polling stations during the first phase of the election for south Kashmir’s Anantnag constituency. (Reuters)


Amidst minimal turnout, the troubled south Kashmir seat has the unique distinction of voting in three phases


The constituency with 1.3 mn voters required more than 300 companies of paramilitary men in addition to a division strength army to ensure an incident-free poll


SRINAGAR: There’s a new driving etiquette on the Jammu-Kashmir highway. From Nowgam (Srinagar) to Qazigund, and perhaps beyond, piercing whistles are audible. Understanding the command in the whistle is the split-second decision one has to make: is it an order to speed away or to halt immediately? The soldiers behind these commands are sometimes invisible. They are positioned in bunkers to avoid being closer to vehicles, a new safety mechanism after the Pulwama attack.


Over the past few weeks, the government has lined the streets and inner roads with thousands of paramilitary men. These reinforcements are considered key to holding the Lok Sabha elections in south Kashmir’s Anantnag constituency in three phases, ending 6 May. When Election Commission of India announced the 3-phase polls, even established Kashmir experts were shocked. Holding an election in three phases marked a new precedence in Indian electoral history.


The four-district constituency with 1.3 million voters required more than 300 companies of paramilitary men in addition to a division strength army, already in place, to ensure an incident-free poll. Later, the ECI granted yet another concession by reducing the voting time by two hours to enable the polling staff to leave their stations in daylight. Jammu and Kashmir’s security grid believes night movement in the region is “deadly"".


In the first leg, the main Anantnag district polled peacefully and the participation was modest: 13.63%. The EVMs were a mixed bag; some carried a modest number of votes and lot many had lower than 10 votes each. Generally, voters remained indifferent. Though the population inhabiting the foothills supported a Gujjar candidate, it’s boiling down to a triangular contest in the plains between Congress’ Ghulam Ahmad Mir, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP’s) Mehbooba Mufti and the National Conference’s Justice (retired) Husnain Masoodi.


Bijbehara, the hometown of Muftis, stayed home, sending only 2% out to vote. Even Mehbooba Mufti’s relatives, including her brother and uncle, did not come out. Two days after polling, the army killed two Hizbul Mujahideen militants not far away from the spot where Mehbooba cast her vote. During campaigning, she avoided addressing a public meeting in her hometown. Even the main Anantnag town polled only 3.47%, much lower than the predicted percentage of even pessimist observers. But the periphery was better. The polling pattern is likely to change as the exercise moves to comparatively “hard"" belts, in the next two weeks. The people and the poll mangers are keeping their fingers crossed and hope the exercise remains peaceful. “I doubt the participation will improve as the poll gets into two remaining phases,"" Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, the Communist lawmaker who represented Kulgam four times, said. “More than fear or anger, it is indifference.""",0

"The back of the smartphone also saw an increase in the number of cameras. The Huawei P20 Pro was the first smartphone to sport three cameras. Other manufacturers also followed suit—the LG V40 ThinQ, Samsung Galaxy A7, Oppo R17 Pro all feature triple camera setups.


The point of adding more cameras is simple—you get a higher range in focal lengths within a slim form factor.


However, the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL were probably the only premium smartphones of 2018 that stuck to a single rear camera. It’s the perfect example of software and hardware working together in symphony.


Top titles like PUBG and Fortnite shot to fame after they were made available on Android and iOS devices. Since these titles are resource heavy, they not only require powerful processors but also sophisticated cooling options.


While Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845, Huawei’s Kirin 970 and Apple’s A12 Bionic were the top chipsets of 2018 in terms of performance, mid-range processors like Snapdragon 636 and MediaTek P60 stole the show by bringing reasonable performance to pocket-friendly smartphones.


That’s not it; bare-basic apps like YouTube, Facebook and even Maps also started becoming a bit more resource hungry, thanks to all the features they pack. These apps have started consuming more internet data, more processing power and more battery.

"Naxalites on Thursday triggered an IED blast, the third in the last three days, in Bastar’s Narayanpur district, in an attempt to disrupt the electoral process. There were no casualties.

Polling booths had also been set up near main roads or arterial points to minimize the chances of an ambush by Naxalites, about five kilometres away from villages.

Design is also important. An air purifier with a three-dimensional air intake is ideal wherein the impure air is drawn in from the sides and bottom, and clean air is thrown out from the top.

"Russia said it will take a wait-and-see approach on whether to extend the OPEC deal because the market has achieved a fragile balance


The partnership at the heart of the OPEC alliance showed further signs of strain after Russia pressured the Saudi-led group to delay a decision on the future of their production cuts.


The unusual recommendation to cancel next month’s scheduled meeting means the group probably won’t decide whether to prolong its supply curbs until late June, just days before they expire.


At talks in Baku, Azerbaijan on Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak convinced the committee overseeing the output cuts that the scheduled April meeting would be too soon to agree an extension. Khalid Al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister who had initially been in favor of making a decision at that time, acquiesced saying “April will be premature.""

"The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)


A national law, the first of its kind in the US, could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data


The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California


Washington: Momentum is gaining in Washington for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the largest technology companies to collect and make money off people's personal data.


A national law, the first of its kind in the US, could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech's profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.


Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have earned riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.


Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up.


The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it's being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely.",1

"The event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino is also meant to drive home — for iPhone fans and anyone in Hollywood who hasn’t been paying attention — just how many shows Apple has pulled together. Five series have completed filming. Around a half dozen more are on the verge of wrapping production, according to several people familiar with the shows who were not authorized to speak publicly. And the number of original productions is expected to increase in 2020.


With all that new material, Apple will transform itself, seemingly overnight, from a tech giant into a more general enterprise, with a slate of original entertainment offerings sizable enough to put it in a league with Showtime, Hulu or FX.


Interviews with more than a dozen people who have had dealings with Apple, all of whom said they couldn’t speak publicly about private discussions, suggest that, while the producers and stars appreciate having another deep-pocketed company to pitch, they also have … well, let’s call them concerns.


Those concerns have arisen from the culture clash that may inevitably come about when a tech company that is used to guarding its trade secrets gets involved in show business, which runs on a stream of conversation, much of it of the just-between-us variety.


Players expect to be kept in the loop. But many of the people working with Apple said they have received little or no information on how, exactly, their shows will be released. Or even when they will be released, other than a vague assurance of “later this year, probably fall."" They also don’t have a clear idea of Apple’s marketing plans for the shows. Or what their colleagues in the newly built Apple stable are up to.


Apple’s entertainment team is based in Culver City, California, historically a center of moviemaking. It is led by two former Sony television executives, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, under the watch of the senior vice president of internet software and services, Eddy Cue. Cue hired the Sony veterans in 2017, after Apple rolled out its first original series, a reality show called “Planet of the Apps,"" which was a dud. About $1 billion was set aside for them to spend on programming, and they have blown well past that amount by now.


While Apple may be a late arrival to the streaming party, its showcase will take place 2 1/2 weeks before Disney is expected to preview elements of its new streaming platform, and many months before Warner Media provides details of its version.


Apple’s entertainment team has not been totally opaque. It has provided feedback to individuals involved in the shows, but it has been tight-lipped about the marketing and rollout plans. The March 25 event may allay Hollywood’s concerns, but several people involved in the new programs have interpreted the lack of communication as a sign that there may not be a clear game plan.

Faced with redemptions, the only way to quickly raise cash is to sell the most liquid asset, which is government bonds.

Having said all this, higher corporate credit exposure doesn’t necessarily mean much higher risk, especially if the bets are placed on corporate bonds that are highly rated. “This is the Indian market. We are always yield-hungry as investors want superior returns. When a safer quasi-public sector issuer can give a higher yield, why bother with a gilt?"" says a fund manager, requesting anonymity.


The problem, however, is when the above logic leads to bets that significantly alter the risk profile of income funds.

"In other foreign capitals, US officials are playing hardball over Huawei, warning allies that the US will reevaluate what intelligence it shares with them if they don’t end cooperation with the company, according to an American official. US officials, mindful of Huawei’s market advantages, are even trying to develop packages of US-made gear to provide foreign companies an alternative to buying Huawei, according to an official involved in that effort.


The campaign to blunt Huawei’s rise appears to be one of Trump’s most successful diplomatic initiatives. Australia, New Zealand and Japan have acceded to US requests to bar Huawei’s 5G equipment. The allies have also banded together to provide aid to the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea to enable them to reject a Huawei submarine cable carrying broadband connections, saying the line represents a national security threat at its connection point in Australia.


In Britain, BT Group Plc has been pulling Huawei equipment out of its core structure since the 2016 acquisition of mobile carrier EE Ltd., which used Huawei gear throughout its systems. It’s also removing Huawei products from the emergency-response network that EE is building in Britain. Germany has said it is considering restricting Huawei’s role in its future telecom infrastructure, while Czech officials have expressed concerns that China is preparing an economically damaging reprisal against the country after Czech authorities issued warnings about Huawei’s risk to national security.


France’s government has been warning about Huawei for some time, according to Orange SA CEO Stephane Richard, who said the company will work with Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj, not Huawei, on its 4G and 5G networks. Following the arrests in Poland, officials there urged the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to find a common approach toward Huawei, rather than leave it to each country to act alone and face possible Chinese retribution.


Some apparent Huawei misconduct isn’t classified. Every night for five years, equipment installed in the Chinese-built headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, transmitted data from midnight to 2 a.m. back to servers in Shanghai, according to an investigation published a year ago in the French newspaper Le Monde. Subsequently, microphones hidden in desks and walls were stripped from the $200 million building, which was financed by China, and Huawei’s servers were replaced, according to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. After the Le Monde report, China called the espionage allegations “ridiculous,’’ and Ebba Kalondo, a spokesperson for the African Union Commission, says it was a “non-story.""


Huawei’s English website still boasts of the “greatly enhanced security"" its systems provided the Addis Ababa headquarters. The African Union’s “legacy PCs were proving too vulnerable to hackers, phishing, viruses, and other forms of compromise,’’ one Huawei post explains.


Bonnie Girard, who lived in China for a decade while working for a string of European telecom companies, remembers visiting a contract manufacturer in the mid-1990s and seeing Huawei engineers brazenly photographing printed circuit boards being built for Alcatel. The Huawei employees could never have accessed the facility without government approval, says Girard, who now runs consulting firm China Channel Ltd.


Still, Huawei has always been completely transparent with Eastern Oregon Telecom about its hardware and software, says Frannel, the CEO. He says he’s never seen “a shred of evidence that would indicate to me that Huawei is a problem."" And in today’s global economy, US and European suppliers rely on Chinese-made parts nearly as much as Huawei does, he adds. “Banning a brand doesn’t solve our security problem.""",1

"Consider generative adversarial networks, or GANs. These are a pair of neural network systems that can automatically generate convincing images or manipulate existing ones.


They do this by playing a kind of cat-and-mouse game: the first network makes millions of tiny changes to an image — snow gets added to summery street scenes, grizzlies transform into pandas, fake faces look so convincing that viewers mistake them for celebrities — in an effort to fool the second network.


The second network does its best not to be fooled. As the pair battle, the image only gets more convincing — the AI trying to detect fakery always loses.


Detecting fake news is even harder. Humans can barely agree on what counts as fake news; how can we expect a machine to do so? And if it could, would we want it to?


Perhaps the only way to stop misinformation is to somehow teach people to view what they see online with extreme distrust. But that may be the hardest fix of them all.

"“The popular perception of Narendra Modi is that of a spotless man… given the ground realities, voters would have been far more critical if there was anyone else at the helm,"" said Sanjay Kumar, director at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi. “Post Pulwama it is only expected that the BJP will push the “nation comes first"" narrative during its campaign pushing real issues of farm distress or joblessness behind. In such a situation, the bickering between the Congress and other regional parties has disappointed voters who were looking for an alternative.""

Between 2014 and 2016 when India reeled under a protracted drought, and 2017 to 2019 when farmers took to the streets seeking better crop prices and loan waivers, agrarian distress has remained a permanent feature in the Narendra Modi regime. As farmers organizations mobilized themselves in large numbers and hit the streets, opposition parties were quick to tap into the latent anger in India’s hinterland.


In the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan last year, the opposition Congress pitched the crisis in agriculture coupled with paucity of jobs as major poll issues and promised loan waivers to farmers.


However, in the aftermath of the Pulwama attacks, the narrative seems to have changed from what the country can do for farmers and its unemployed youth to what these disadvantaged groups can do for the country.


With Congress president Rahul Gandhi still harping on the Rafale jet deal, a controversy which finds little resonance in rural India, Narendra Modi has tried to turn these accusations on its head by launching a “main bhi chowkidar"" campaign. In this din, a fragmented opposition is fast losing the plot vis-a-vis real problems: from the crisis in the sugarcane economy to growing losses in dairy farming.


In Uttar Pradesh, the menace of stray cattle is eating into already stressed incomes, but farmers are being made to believe losing a part of one’s crop and much of one’s sleep is a minor sacrifice for the sake of religion. The current situation also underlines the fault lines in India’s farmer movements. It may be tough to organize a protest march, but it is still far more difficult to make farmers vote on issues related to agriculture.",0

Both these examples highlight the melding of technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) with the real world to give users and businesses a world of the so-called “mixed"" reality (MR) or “blended"" reality concept.


While VR is all about a world created solely on computers or online, AR still deals with the real world and has elements of the virtual world built atop it, akin to layers of information. MR mixes both realities (VR and AR) in a bid to capture the best of both worlds. However, for mixed reality to gain traction, you need headsets and mixed reality content too.


Regardless, investors believe that mixed reality has the potential to become the next big computing platform. Consider this. No one had seen the Magic Leap One goggles ever. Yet, the company managed to raise investments of almost $2 billion, notably from Google, Alibaba Group, Temasek and JP Morgan Investment Management.

The global MR market size is expected to reach $2.8 billion by 2023, according to research firm Reportbuyer.com. It believes that the rapid growth will come from increasing demand for innovative and wearable products. The aerospace and defence sectors, it says, could use MR products for training programmes. The technology can also be used effectively in schools since it provides 3-D images, leading to an interactive learning experience, according to the report.

"Around 46% of Indian youth have ‘no interest at all’ in politics and 18% only have ‘little interest’, according to a CSDS-KAS survey. (Arvind Yadav/HT)


Social media and shared consumption tastes among the youth do not offer reliable clues to their political attitudes


Blind focus on political preferences of youth is driven by dependence of political parties on market and election survey agencies


Romantic images of youth as a time of wanton freedom and exuberant spirits surround us. Youthfulness, it would appear, is an experience present everywhere at all times. In practice, however, this view will seem incorrect. Consider the Indian experience. For centuries, marriage at an early age and survival in a subsistence economy meant that the brahmacharya—the bachelor student phase of life in scriptural texts, a rough equivalent for the age now viewed as youth—did not exist for most people in India.


The spread of formal schooling and the arrival of higher education alongside the creation of an industrial economy, and the emergence of legal regulation of the age of marriage fundamentally transformed the experience of age and brought new demographic categories like teenage, youth, middle-class and, more recently, the millennials into public discussion. The enmeshment of “age"" with social and political processes is often glossed over in public commentaries.


A recent report in The Indian Express observed that 81 million young Indians will vote for the first time in the 2019 general elections, and could decisively influence electoral outcomes in 282 parliamentary constituencies. The report also said there will be an estimated average of 14.9 million first-time eligible voters in each Lok Sabha constituency and this figure is larger than the winning margin in 297 seats in 2014. Reports like these tacitly suggest that the first-time voters, unlike the older ones, are impressionable and lacking in evolved political attitudes.


Are the millennials a political constituency? Do they share a distinct set of political views from having lived through a time of fast socio-economic transformations? Indeed, these questions are a natural corollary of the results of the YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey of over 5,000 respondents spread across 180 cities published in the pages of this newspaper. The survey showed that a large proportion of millennials (someone born between 1981 and 1996 and is aged 22 to 37 years in 2018, according to Pew Research Center) prefer to access news on digital platforms, spend their leisure time on social media and shop online.


Speculations about the political inclinations of the millennials will need to confront the stark, sobering fact of high political indifference among the Indian youth. According to a 2016 report Anxieties and aspirations of India’s youth: Changing patterns by Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)-Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), which surveyed over 6,000 respondents aged between 15 and 34 years in 19 states, 46% of Indian youth have “no interest at all"" in politics and 18% only have “little interest"".",0
"The situation is worse for the Congress-NCP combine, hit by defections to the BJP and disheartened by veteran NCP boss Sharad Pawar’s decision not to contest the elections. Nominations for 48 Lok Sabha seats from Maharashtra are to be filed from 18 to 25 March. The first of the four- phase election in Maharashtra is on 11 April when seven seats go to polls.


On Tuesday, Prakash Ambedkar, president of the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM), said at a press conference, “All proposals for alliance and seat-sharing talks with the Congress are over"" and set a deadline of 15 March for the Congress to take a final decision over forming a grand alliance against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Ambedkar also declared that the Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi that he had formed with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) would announce its candidates for all 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra on 15 March if the Congress failed to respond. Ambedkar, grandson of B.R Ambedkar, has demanded 22 seats from the Congress-NCP combine, a proposal which he said the Congress had rejected. “There is no question of scaling down our demand for 22 seats because we have already announced those seats. Since the Congress has rejected that, the deadline for declaring a grand alliance with Congress is over,"" he said.",0

"One reason: Savvy marketers in the US, for instance, use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to make these unwanted calls instead of using a traditional telephone line. This allows them to imitate a different phone number every time and bypass spam identification networks, explained Paul Dunlop, product manager, Google Phone app, in a Google blog post.


In countries like India where these services are not allowed by operators, marketers use multiple connections and frequently switch SIM cards. Free SMS and unlimited calling offered by some operators allow such networks to thrive at a low cost. “Existing rules require telemarketers to register their numbers and check the DND registry before making unsolicited calls. However, many unregistered telemarketers work outside the system. Even if customer’s report them, they quickly change their number which makes regulating them difficult,"" rues Rajan S. Mathews, director general, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).


Persistent failure to curb spam calls can be attributed to the lax attitude of operators and the passive attitude of users to some extent. Mathews says only 30% subscribers have registered on the DND registry so far.",1

Parents should pay particularly close attention until they are fully familiar with their smart cards, said Dee Pachlhofer, who, along with her mother, is raising two nephews, Jason Pachlhofer, 15, and Chris Wright, 10, in Springfield, Missouri. Dee Pachlhofer said she worried about Jason’s having enough cash when he was on outings to places like Silver Dollar City, a local amusement park. So she signed up for the Current card.


There was one initial snag, she said. At first, Jason used the card to sign up for subscription items, like audiobook apps, that offered free trials but then began charging fees. She had to help him cancel the services, and ultimately had a new card issued and started over.


Current’s website says there can be gaps in its spending restrictions, particularly when the card is used on sites like iTunes, Xbox and Amazon. In some cases, blocked purchases may still go through because of the payment systems those sites use.

You also have the flexibility of editing your tracks on the fly and add drumkits and bass rhythms as well, since all you need now is a MIDI controller. For all you know, you can turn your computer’s keyboard into a Grand Piano to fill out some empty sounding sections of a song you just created. The only downside—they will cost you at least ₹ 50,000 to get your hands on truly authentic effects.


Some popular guitar pedals include BOSS Distortion DS-1 (distortion), Holy Grail Reverb, Cry Baby (wah pedal), Ibanez Tube Scream (overdrive) and BOSS Loop Station RC-1 (loop).


You can turn your electric guitar into a Bluetooth guitar (your “Oh Oh Jaane Jaana"" dream might come true) by connecting a Bluetooth transmitter in it. They are great for compact setups where having cords can be a nightmare, but not so for outdoor concerts as range can be an issue. You can try out Joyo JW-01 or Vox Amplug 2 if you want a wireless guitar playing experience.


Guitar upgrades are not going to come in cheap, but they certainly reap rewards in the long run. They will also not teach you how to play a pentatonic scale—skill comes only with practice. They are only an extension of your personality and the music you wish to create.

"Programs like Amazon Web Services’ Simple Storage Service, essentially an internet-accessed hard drive, offer clients the choice of whether to make the data visible to just the person who uploaded it, other members of their company, or anyone online. Sometimes, that information is designed to be public-facing, as in the case of a cache of photos or other images stored for use on a corporate website.


Other times, it isn’t. In recent years, information stored on several cloud services -- U.S. military data, personal information of newspaper subscribers and cell phone users -- has been inadvertently shared publicly online and discovered by security researchers.


Amazon in the last two years has beefed up protocols to keep customers from exposing sensitive materials, adding prominent warning notices, making tools for administrators to more simply turn off all public facing items, and offering for free what was formerly a paid add-on to check a customer’s account for exposed data.


“Originally I would have put a lot of this on AWS,"" said Corey Quinn, who advises businesses that use Amazon’s cloud at the Duckbill Group, a consulting firm. But since Amazon has taken steps to address the issue, companies like Cultura should be aware, he said. “With all of this in the news, and all of this continuing to come out, if you’re still opening AWS buckets [to the public], you’re not paying attention.""


Amazon isn’t the only company that periodically gets caught up in cases of private records mistakenly made public. But it has a wide lead in the business of selling rented data storage and computing power, putting a spotlight on Seattle-based company’s practices.

Essentially, it means that Yes Bank took it for granted that fees on structured loan deals will be paid and accounted for upfront on its books. As borrowers turned defaulters, the fees tied to these loan deals fell off the cracks. Gill has now vowed to shift to a safer accounting practice of amortizing fee income rather than booking these upfront.


Gill’s move to mend past ways means that there will be no nasty surprises in the future. This is good news considering that investors love a clean image and loathe uncertainties.

“Britannia continues to gain market share in its core biscuits category, coupled with a stepped-up focus on building new categories,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 2 May.


But new launches also mean higher marketing expenses, which is why margins fell in the March quarter. “While new categories would aid topline growth in the near term, they would restrict margin expansion given investments needed in the scale-up,"" added the Jefferies India report.


There are some other worries as well. “We have concerns on the increase in ICD (inter-corporate deposits) to group companies over FY2015-18,"" wrote analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a report on 2 May. ICDs have increased to ₹350 crore in FY18 (10% of net worth, and 42% of free cash-flow) from ₹50 crore in FY14, added the brokerage firm.


Collectively, these factors seemed to have weighed on Britannia’s shares on Thursday, dragging the stock down 4% on the National Stock Exchange. Even after Thursday’s drop, it’s not as if the valuations have turned inexpensive. The stock still quotes at a pricey 47 times estimated earnings for FY20. Going ahead, better volume growth rates hold the key to ensure valuations don’t get bitten into.",3

"""The greatest downside risk to our oil price view is demand weakness on slower economic growth. Our base case is that global oil demand will increase by 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019... A synchronized global slowdown in growth could push global demand growth to below 1 million bpd,"" Bernstein Energy said on Monday.


U.S. manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in February, in a sign that the world's biggest economy has been slowing down in the first quarter.


In Asia, Japan's exports fell for a third straight month in February in a sign of growing strain from slowing global demand.


Despite this, oil prices have gained around a quarter since the start of the year amid U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, and as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-affiliated allies like Russia - known as OPEC - have pledged to withhold 1.2 million bpd in supply to prop up prices.",3
"“If the government is serious about cow protection, then they will come out with a proper framework and not just empty laws. If we leave our land unattended, it will be raided by hundreds of stray cattle which will destroy the entire crop. If they have made strict rules, they should take care of the cattle as well,"" Naresh Singh Kushwaha, a farmer from Chura Salawar village said.


Ahead of elections, the NDA government announced the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme to provide small and marginal farmers who have less than 2 hectares of landholding up to ₹6,000 per year as minimum income support. However, on the ground, there is lack of clarity on the scheme and low-level corruption.


“There are some people who have got money while others have not. There is no clarity on the eligibility criteria for the scheme. Even though the government has come out with some good schemes, the local leadership which gives out funds indulges in corruption. Being a dry area, there is difficulty to get water; pipelines have increased but we do not get proper prices for our crops,"" Gulab Singh, a farmer from Mahepura village of Lalitpur district in Jhansi said.",0
"The Redmi Note 6 Pro also gets an edge in the battery department, as it has a 4,000mAh battery while the Mi A2 has a battery capacity of 3,000mAh. Xiaomi has skipped the headphone jack on the Mi A2 in favour of a USB Type-C port, while the Redmi Note 6 Pro retains the 3.5mm jack along with the traditional Micro USB slot.


To conclude, it's clear that if you want faster performance with a better camera and the future proof USB Type-C port, you should opt for the Mi A2. On the flip side, if you want a better battery life, a slightly taller screen along with a headphone jack and Micro USB slot, you are better off with the Redmi Note 6 Pro.",1

"Pursuing higher prices also risks straining the Saudis’ critical alliance with Russia, which is co-operating with OPEC in the pact to curtail supply. President Vladimir Putin said last week that he’s comfortable with current price levels, and that it’s too soon to decide whether output needs to be restrained in the second half.


To avoid a repeat of last year, Saudi Arabia could increase production slightly, stopping a surge in prices. The kingdom is cutting output by considerably more than required under the OPEC accord, and so it could raise supplies without breaching the pact.


On April 8, less than two weeks after President Trump urged OPEC to increase production, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said that his priority of “bringing back inventories to a reasonable level remains unchanged.""


Saudi Arabia faces powerful domestic pressures to press on with the policy, from Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman’s plans for radical economic transformation to a government budget that hinges on oil prices of $80 a barrel.


In April 2018, when oil was trading at about $70, the Saudis signaled at an OPEC gathering in Jeddah they were comfortable allowing crude to climb even higher. Their stance provoked a furious response from President Trump, and though Riyadh initially brushed off his concerns, within two months they bowed to his wishes and raised production.",3

"Simon’s study concerned the kidnapping, in the summer of 2014, of three Israeli teenagers who were hitchhiking in the West Bank. The kidnapping led to an enormous Israeli military incursion into the West Bank; the boys were found dead over two weeks later.


The Israeli military had instituted a gag order on press reports of the kidnapping, but on WhatsApp, Israelis began circulating stories about “something"" being up. Through careful field research, Simon collected and sought to identify the source of many rumors that spread on WhatsApp in the earliest hours after the kidnapping.


The rumors, Simon found, had a remarkable amount of detail. Several included the names of the kidnapped boys, which had not been made public. A few offered key facts about the search. And at least one of the rumors seemed deliberately intended to deceive — it said the boys had been rescued and that the militants who kidnapped them were killed.


Simon tracked down the rumors to a surprising source: journalists and other civilians who had been briefed on the operation and who had used WhatsApp to leak details to their families or colleagues in small groups they assumed were private.


The rumor that said the boys had been rescued was the most widely circulated. Of the people Simon interviewed, “two shared it only with one family member, two shared it with their WhatsApp family group, one shared it with an IDF officers’ WhatsApp group, one first-responder shared it verbally with his colleagues during his shift and one refused to answer the question,"" he wrote, referring to the Israeli Defense Forces by the initials.


The story here isn’t of malicious and indiscriminate rumor-mongering, Simon told me. It is, rather, a story of a few people who trusted other people, who in turn trusted others, each passing along what he or she considered important and necessary information to friends and colleagues.


It’s a story of human nature. And that’s why, beyond learning to inhibit our natural tendency to share, it’s hard to know what can be done about false news on WhatsApp — other than bracing yourself for more.",1

Ashabai Bhogappa Kamble, 45, is struggling to extract whatever little water is left at the bottom of a well in a bucket tied to a long rope. In the morning, a tanker contracted by the government had poured around 6,000 litres into the well. “That’s all we have for the day. The next tanker for this well will come tomorrow morning,"" Kamble says. Nearby, Siddharam Balshingkar, 30, is trying to balance two plastic pots on his bicycle.

Cybersecurity gains centrestage, as IoT and devices proliferate: If you’re like most executives, you already know cybersecurity is a major threat. We estimate 40-50 billion connected devices by 2020, and even the most innocuous connected device once inflicted with malware can cripple infrastructure, networks, and put lives in jeopardy, especially in industrial settings. To add to this, increased adoption of blockchain ecosystems means a greater territory to defend for our organizations. So, why are most firms still struggling with cybersecurity? A BCG study of 50 recent major data breaches found that only 28% were caused by inadequate security tech. In the vast majority of cases; 72% of the breaches were a result of organizational failure, process failure, or employee negligence. Looking ahead, we recommend enterprises to assess their existing defence, devise a robust cybersecurity strategy and drive resilience measures through frameworks, technologies and rapid response teams.


Brace up for the 5G age: 5G is touted as our carrier for a digitally evolved India.

A share buyback is a process through which a company purchases equity from its shareholders, usually at a price near to or higher than the prevailing market price. When a company buys back equity, it reduces its outstanding shares in the market.


Under the buyback, Wipro proposes to buy up to 32.30 crore shares for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹10,500 crore, at a price of ₹325. This constitutes 5.35% of the total paid-up equity share capital of the company",3

"Last year, Facebook started an audit of thousands of apps and suspended hundreds until they could make sure they weren’t mishandling user data. Facebook now offers rewards for researchers who find problems with its third-party apps.


A Facebook spokesperson said that the company’s policies prohibit storing Facebook information in a public database. Once it was alerted to the issue, Facebook worked with Amazon to take down the databases, the spokesperson said, adding that Facebook is committed to working with the developers on its platform to protect people’s data.


In the Cultura Colectiva dataset, which totaled 146 gigabytes, it was difficult for researchers to know how many unique Facebook users were affected. UpGuard also had trouble working to get the database closed. The firm sent emails to Cultura Colectiva and Amazon over many months to alert them to the problem. It wasn’t until Facebook contacted Amazon that the leak was addressed. Cultura Colectiva didn’t respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment.


This latest example shows how the data security issues can be amplified by another trend: the transition many companies have made from running operations predominantly in their own data centers to cloud-computing services operated by Amazon, Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and others.

"PSU firms, including Coal India Ltd., NHPC Ltd., are on a buying spree to help the govt to meet asset-sale target


Seven weeks into 2019, two dozen companies led by technology major Infosys Ltd. have announced or completed plans to buy ₹170.5 billion ($2.4 billion) of their own stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This compares with about ₹545 billion for all of 2018, which was the highest in at least six years, the data show.

"Data from the Mission Antyodaya, a nationwide survey of villages conducted by the ministry of rural development, also points to these differences. Around 20% of India’s households received less than 8 hours of electricity and only 47% received more than 12 hours, suggesting that another NDA promise—24x7 power for all households by 2019—is very much unlikely to be met.


A big reason for low-quality electricity supply is the financial health of the power distribution companies (power discoms), which are responsible for distributing electricity at the state level. Low tariffs mandated by governments, electricity theft and weak infrastructure mean that state power discoms are burdened by losses and debts. In March 2015, discoms had accumulated losses worth ₹3.8 trillion—3% of gross domestic product (GDP)—and outstanding debt worth ₹4.3 trillion.


To tackle this, the NDA launched the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) in 2015 as a bailout scheme in which power discoms could convert their debt into government bonds as long as they met certain conditions. While 27 states have joined the scheme and ₹2.3 trillion worth of government bonds have been issued, few meet the necessary conditions.


One condition under UDAY Scheme is to reduce aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) in delivering electricity. AT&C losses, a major reason for discom struggles, arise from electricity theft and transmission losses due to weak infrastructure. UDAY mandated that states keep AT&C losses under 15% by 2018-19.


Since the scheme’s launch, aggregate AT&C losses across India has fallen from 21% in 2015-16 to 18% in 2017-18. But this decrease is largely a result of a handful of over-performing discoms in the five southern states and Gujarat. These states are the only ones likely to meet the 15% target. The other condition of UDAY was for power discoms to ensure commercial sustainability by bridging the gap between revenues and costs.",0

"The Huawei Mate 20 Pro has three cameras at the back arranged in a radial fashion, with a dual LED flash completing a squarish pattern


This year saw the launch of the world's first smartphones with more than two cameras. Here are some of them you can buy now in India


mint-india-wire Huawei Mate 20 ProHuawei P20 Prosamsung galaxy a9Samsung Galaxy A7LG V40 Thinqsmartphones with 3 camerassmartphones with 4 cameras


How many cameras are too many cameras? That’s one of the many questions you might ask before you purchase a smartphone today. There was once a time when having a single camera on your phone was a novelty factor. Then players like HTC, LG and Apple set a trend for dual rear smartphone cameras, which add extra flexibility and diversity to photography experience.


Just 10 months ago, Huawei launched the world’s first smartphone with three rear cameras—the P20 Pro. It boasts a not-so-ordinary dual camera setup with a whopping 40-megapixel sensor along with an eight-megapixel sensor fitted with a Leica lens capable of 3x optical zoom.


This was followed by a flurry of activity in the smartphone industry with manufacturers like Samsung and LG rushing to put forward their rendition of a triple-camera setup. Samsung, in October, even became the first smartphone maker to launch a smartphone with four rear cameras, namely the Galaxy A9. Most of these smartphones were launched internationally and have gradually made their way to India. Here are the hottest smartphones with three rear cameras or more.


The current flagship in Huawei’s line-up, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro has three cameras at the back arranged in a radial fashion, with a dual LED flash completing a squarish pattern. The primary camera has a 40MP sensor and is fitted with a 27mm wide-angle lens, with an aperture of f/1.7. Below that, there’s a 20MP sensor with a 16mm ultra-wide lens. Finally, you have an 80mm telephoto lens sitting on top of an 8MP sensor, providing a 5x optical zoom.",1
"While gait analysis has been used as supportive evidence in the UK and the Netherlands, its use for forensic purposes has been limited or non-existential elsewhere. However, authorities across the world are now showing increasing interest. China which has one of the largest CCTV networks in the world, with 170 million cameras across the country, is using a new surveillance system developed by the Chinese AI startup Watrix, which can identify individuals from a distance of 50 meters based purely on the shape of their body and style of walk.


Experts, however, believe that gait analysis is still at a very nascent stage and more research is required to attain results which are more precise.


A joint team of researchers from the Netherlands Forensic Institute, in a paper published in Forensic Sciences Research in February 2018, acknowledge the veracity of gait analysis but also argues that humans can adjust their gait according to circumstances. It also claims that the quality of the footage, frame rates, and the lack of solid scientific knowledgebase about intra and inter-subject variability in gait features can affect the analysis.


However, there are studies which suggest that a careful examination of the walking style of a suspect with that of the criminal in the CCTV footage by skilled observers can nudge authorities in the right direction. One such study was carried out by a leading British forensic gait analyst, Ivan Birch, in 2013. Published in the Science and Justice Journal, the study hired seven gait analysts and asked them to examine five CCTV samples, where each sample showed a target walker and five suspect walkers, to determine which of the suspect walkers was the target walker. All the walkers were wearing identical loose-fitting clothing to mask their body contours and had their faces covered. At the end of the study, the analysts correctly identified the suspect walker in 71% of the cases. However, it was also found that correct decisions were higher in cases where the footage of the target walker and that of the suspect walker were captured from the same angle by the CCTV camera.


A major limitation of forensic gait analysis is the fact that it often requires interpretation of research that has been conducted under controlled environments through clinical gait analysis, claims a joint report by the Royal Society of Scotland and the Judicial College published in November 2017.


It argues that unlike forensic gait analysis, clinical gait analysis is more planned and organized, with multiple cameras and sophisticated equipment to capture every little detail related to a person’s gait in order to carry out three-dimensional measurements. Whereas, in forensic gait analysis, experts often have to rely on CCTV camera footage which may not always be in the ideal position or may be marred by poor lighting or camera quality, often resulting in angles being estimated from a two-dimensional video.


Then, there is the question of how unique is a person’s gait. Studies have shown that a person’ gait may vary based on the person’s speed, the crowding on the street, the nature of the surface, the time of the day, physical conditions, footwear, and the amount of alcohol he/she has had.


As far as laws in India are concerned, “any kind of evidence in electronic format is admissible in courts, under section 65A of the Indian Evidence Act,"" points out advocate Pavan Duggal. However, if the analysis is based on the interpretation of an expert witness, some sort of technical qualification or training will have to be produced. Self-proclaimed experts won’t suffice, adds Duggal.",1

"“Essentially, what has been done is that the money has been proxied to political consultancies so that they do not come under the ECI scanner,"" said Pratik Sinha, co-founder of AltNews. “These pages are being run by tens of admins and it is not rookie content. It is created by professionals. Now, there is no accountability on how much money is being spent online and it is a serious issue. The ECI needs to recognize that these pages are doing continuous political propaganda and ask where the money is coming from,"" he added.


The problem of proxy campaigning is not limited to just unofficial pages or manufactured Twitter trends. Issue-based campaigning by seemingly unrelated third-parties is a hornet’s nest on which there appears to be no consensus on the way forward.


For example, take the case of online ads on the need for a Ram temple in the middle of an election campaign. “If there is significant expenditure on an ad around Ram Temple, it won’t be counted as BJP expenditure unless the name of the party and candidate appear on the ads, which is not a necessity for the BJP, because the issue is something that they have been so vehemently taking up that by default it favours their narrative,"" says Ankit Lal, a social media and IT strategist with the Aam Aadmi Party.


With a seemingly endless amount of campaign material pouring forth from official and unofficial sources and campaigns seamlessly jumping across platforms, there appear to be question marks about how the ECI will go about identifying content that violates the MCC and use its new grievance redressal channels to take such content down. Neither the platforms nor the ECI has said much about the free speech implications of taking content down.


For now, the official pronouncements appear to be focused on the removal of problematic content. The ECI has added social media experts to its district and state-level election Media Certification and Monitoring Committees and has launched an app called cVigil through which MCC violations, both online and offline, can be reported.


However, its record of responding to complaints appears to be less than stellar. “My experience has been that they do not respond for a month or a month-and-a-half,"" said Shivam Shankar Singh, a political activist who has worked on a number of election campaigns since 2015. “Usually, they try to delay it till after the elections, at which point, they’ll say that the election is already over, so nothing needs to be done with the complaint.""


On 11 March, Singh filed a complaint through the ECI’s website about a video clip featuring Rahul Gandhi that was shared on Twitter by BJP MP and Union minister Smriti Irani. The clip was edited out of context to give the impression that Gandhi was being respectful towards Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar. The video was accompanied by the hashtag #RahulLovesTerrorists.


“If she put up a hoarding saying that Rahul Gandhi is a terrorist sympathizer, then, that would be against the model code. If the same metric is being applied, calling him a terrorist sympathizer on Twitter should also be against the model code,"" said Singh.

"While a section of BJP-leaning youth have more conservative or strident views on certain issues, it is worth noting that a sizable section of BJP-leaning youth also have diametrically opposite views on the same issues. BJP-leaning youth are also only slightly more likely to identify their religious identity as their primary identity in life. Only 17% of BJP supporters (as opposed to 14% among others) said that their religious identity was most important, to a question about which identity they considered the most important in life. A much greater proportion (31%) felt that their linguistic identity was more important. Among millennials and post-millennials who don’t support the ruling party, 26% felt that their linguistic identity was most important.


The question on identity allowed multiple responses to each respondents and, on all the identity parameters listed (language, religion, caste, nationality, work/union, college/alumni group), the share of BJP-leaning youth who considered these important is higher than non-BJP supporters. Perhaps, questions of identity hold a greater place in the hearts of BJP-leaning youth compared to others. And, not all of them think that their national identity or Indian-ness is the most important or the only identity that matters. Only a quarter of BJP supporters felt that their nationality (Indian) was the most important identity, or was among the most important identities in life. Among the youth who don’t support the BJP, this share was a bit lower at 18%.

IT/ITES companies faced the most number of threats, with over 40% of the threats targeting the industry. Other key sectors such as manufacturing (17.88%), education (12.56%), and hospitality (9.17%) were also deemed to be at risk.


Speaking on the report, Sanjay Katkar, Joint Managing Director and Chief Technology Officer, Quick Heal Technologies Limited said “there is no denying that enterprises face an unparalleled security challenge today. Growing interconnectivity has demolished traditional security perimeters. Every endpoint, every node, every device connected to enterprise networks has become a point of entry for attackers looking to steal invaluable information and disrupt business operations. Attacks are becoming smarter and more targeted, and are causing much greater damage. In this context, the Seqrite Quarterly Threat Report Q3 2018 serves to underline the sheer scale of risk that Indian organisations are exposed to, at present.""",1
"SMA-2 accounts are those where the dues have not been cleared for up to 60 days. These are accounts that are most likely to turn bad, as borrowers have only a month to pay back.


What this means is that the lender managed to make some of these borrowers pay up. However, it should be noted that from a year-ago period, SMA-2 has almost doubled.

"Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for 5G networks. Britain has decided it can mitigate the alleged risks arising from the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks, the Financial Times reported on 17 February. Meanwhile, Canada is reviewing whether its gear presents a serious security threat. The US is also pursuing criminal charges against Huawei, including money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets.


Earlier this month, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo cautioned allies that deploying equipment from Huawei would make it more difficult for the US to partner with them, said an 11 February Reuters report. The Indian government plans to study network security concerns arising from the presence of Chinese equipment vendors in India, telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan said on Wednesday. It has not taken a decision yet on whether to allow Huawei to participate in 5G trials.


“We believe that the DoT (department of telecommunications) is making an effort to carefully study cyber security issues, which is part of the efforts of the global industry to build and strengthen universal cybersecurity standards, which will eventually be used as the basis to judge whether all vendors’ equipment are secure or not, based on data and facts,"" Chen said.",1
"And true to the strategy, Philips’ TV is capable of better contrast than TVs from say Xiaomi, though Samsung, Sony and LG’s high-end UHD offerings are noticeably superior. In a nutshell, picture quality on this TV is in line with its pricing.


The deal-breaker here though are the peripheral features of the TV. Philips’ Saphi operating system isn’t as advanced as AndroidTV, Tizen (Samsung) or WebOS. It’s simple and meant to bring apps to the television. It has Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube, Eros Now, but that’s about the only options you have for streaming video.


What’s frustrating though is the TV’s remote. It seems to work wirelessly at times, but some features will still only work through infrared (IR), like turning the TV on or toggling volume. Here though, the remote often doesn’t respond you expect it to, which is quite annoying.",1
"Elections to all 40 Lok Sabha constituencies in Bihar will take place from 11 April onwards. All eyes are on the state, where the political situation, especially the state of alliances, has changed drastically since the general elections in 2014. Mint takes a look.


Bihar is a test case as it is one of the largest states where a rainbow alliance of opposition parties is taking on the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Over the last five years, alliances in Bihar have changed at least thrice. Now, almost all the key opposition parties are part of the mahagathbandhan or grand alliance. This has significantly altered the electoral dynamics of the state. With the alliances changing so many times since the elections to the Lok Sabha in 2014, it would also be interesting to see if there is vote transfer between the new alliance partners in the state.",0

"The group has compiled a long list of what made 2018 so ominous, though many are examples of the public simply becoming newly aware of problems that have built up for years. Among the most troubling cases was the revelation in March that political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica swept up personal information of millions of Facebook users for the purpose of manipulating national elections.


“It really helped wake up people to the fact that these systems are actually touching the core of our lives and shaping our social institutions,"" Whittaker said.


That was on top of other Facebook disasters, including its role in fomenting violence in Myanmar , major data breaches and ongoing concerns about its hosting of fake accounts for Russian propaganda .


It wasn’t just Facebook. Google attracted concern about its continuous surveillance of users after The Associated Press reported that it was tracking people’s movements whether they like it or not.


It also faced internal dissent over its collaboration with the US military to create drones with “computer vision"" to help find battlefield targets and a secret proposal to launch a censored search engine in China. And it unveiled a remarkably human-like voice assistant that sounds so real that people on the other end of the phone didn’t know they were talking to a computer.


Those and other concerns bubbled up in December as lawmakers grilled Google CEO Sundar Pichai at a congressional hearing — a sequel to similar public reckonings this year with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other tech executives.


“It was necessary to convene this hearing because of the widening gap of distrust between technology companies and the American people,"" Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.


Internet pioneer Vint Cerf said he and other engineers never imagined their vision of a worldwide network of connected computers would morph 45 years later into a surveillance system that collects personal information or a propaganda machine that could sway elections.",1
"As the North-East goes to polls for its 25 Lok Sabha seats, voters are caught in the throes of a narrative that pits the politics of identity against development. While the former is intricately woven around themes of ethnicity, language and religion, the latter is driven by promises development and political stability.


“They are trying to divide the region on communal lines,"" said Bobbeeta Sharma, a Congress spokesperson. “It is in the BJP’s interest to keep the issue of illegal immigration and Hindutva going in order to divert attention from the slow pace of development in the region,"" she said.


Senior BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is often credited with the party’s rise in the region, denies the charge. “If the BJP is able to put up a good show in the region, it will be only because of the progressive policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" he said. “We have announced massive infrastructure projects in the region which include rail connectivity to all states by 2020.""


In 2014, the NDA won 11 seats in the region with the BJP alone winning eight. It made further inroads after forming governments in Manipur and Tripura, riding on the plank of development and checking illegal immigration although many second and third generation Muslims settled in India have been caught in the snare of ‘illegal immigrants’.",0

“I believe you can innovate your way out of a mature market,"" he said, noting that when Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, most industry watchers believed that the market had matured for $100 “candy bar"" phones without touchscreens.


Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research said that the work Samsung had done with Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. to adapt applications to the new screen was important.


He said that though Samsung had teased the folding phone before, “to see it in action, to see the software—I was like, wow. It’s hugely important that the software experience be good"".


The Galaxy Fold, which can operate three apps simultaneously and boasts six cameras, also challenges the notion of what a phone can cost, debuting at nearly twice the price of current top-of-the-line models from Apple and Samsung itself.


“Due to price, it’s likely to be sold mainly to early adopters. Prices are key to expanding sales,"" said former Samsung mobile executive Kim Yong-serk, who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea. “It will help Samsung burnish an image as an innovative company, but it is unlikely to be profitable.

"In July when Apple reported its most recent quarter, the company had its worst quarter of Mac sales since 2010, with unit volumes down 13% year over year. And iPad unit sales were up only 1% versus a year earlier, and revenue for both was down 5% from the prior year.


But some of that dip in Mac sales was explained by timing - Apple waited to release new Macs until July, when it had in previous years offered them in June. More broadly, Mac sales growth has outpaced the PC market and the iPad has been the most successful tablet in a market that turned out to be smaller than Apple hoped when it released the device in 2010.

Apple currently works with chipmaker Corp., which doesn’t expect to be able to sell 5G components at scale until 2020. If Apple sticks with that supplier, it may not get a phone out in the market until 2020 or even 2021, according to Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.


The company could also develop something internally: Recent job ads have hinted that Apple may be developing its own 5G chip. But that approach may be more challenging. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.

"The deep self identification of the Janata Dal (Secular) as a farmers’ party with a rural base has meant a near indifference towards cultivating support among urban voters. Nearly all of its spokespersons transact only in Kannada and do not display urban savviness. Since rural communitarian culture is found among the migrant as well as the non-migrant populations in cities, “the rural"" and “the urban"" are better seen as forms of social dwelling rather than spatial categories.


The specificities of regional socio-economic structures make for a varied millennial experience. Higher levels of university education and greater exposure to social diversity and new economic opportunities among the millennials in the cities of South India sets them apart from their counterparts in some of the northern states. The all-English interaction with Congress president Rahul Gandhi seen in Stella Maris College in Chennai is hard to imagine in an undergraduate girls college in Uttar Pradesh.


The regional variations in social media ecologies reflect the above diversity. The aggressiveness with which the BJP supporters intervene in Karnataka’s social media, for instance, contrasts starkly with their diffidence in social media groups in Nagaland. Likewise, the Congress’s affirmation of Christian values on social media platforms in Nagaland stands in sharp contrast with its official secular self-image.


In both Bengaluru and Dimapur, most youth access information on smartphones from the similar websites and aspire to a similar lifestyle, but their political preferences can diverge sharply. Social media dependence and shared consumption tastes among the youth in themselves do not offer reliable clues to their political attitudes. Memes, news clips, home videos, fake news and an assortment of other materials in digital space have shaken up the horizons of millions of Indians. The social media technologies alongside greater domestic and international travel and new cultures of consumption and entertainment have indeed influenced the cultural tastes and political values of the millennials.


The influence though unfolds against immense social heterogeneity across the country which precludes the emergence of millennials as a singular political community. The appeal of the category of “millennial"" in election discussions then probably owes to the growing dependence of political parties on market and election survey agencies for gauging the mood of voters.


Hindi films like Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), which celebrate a consumption-driven hip urban youth culture detached from community life, were blockbuster hits in big cities but failed to click in small towns. A sense for the ethos animating the lives of small town youth can be found in films like Masaan (2015) and Mukkabaaz (2018), where protagonists find themselves in painful entanglements of caste, class and gender.

"Polling staff who trek to isolated and far flung hamlets in snowbound areas in Himalayas are forced to carry oxygen cylinders, sleeping bags, food, torches, as well as electronic voting machines and indelible ink to set up polling booths.


The commission sets up a polling booth for a lone voter in the Gir forest in western state of Gujarat, where lions roam. It also protected a polling station in Chhattisgarh by deploying a medical team to prevent a swarm of honeybees attacking voters.


In 2014, one 98-year-old man in Himachal Pradesh trudged several miles to vote -- a tradition he has kept up since first poll held in independent India in 1951.


More and more women are coming out to vote. Women outnumbered men at polling booths in half of India’s states in 2014 in an election that created history with the highest ever female voter turnout of 65.63 percent.


Still women do not have equal representation in parliament -- they make up only 11.42 percent of lawmakers in lower house despite constituting 47 percent of the electorate.


In last election women manged some polling stations. This time, the commission plans to set up more “pink polling booths"" managed by women officials to motivate female voters.",0
"Educators: Overall this category could see a rise in incremental jobs of 8 million to 9 million by 2030 in India. Teachers and trainers will see a significant increase in demand, especially if countries with young populations and the knowledge economy grow. Demand for early childhood educators will grow as women enter the workforce in greater numbers and more childcare is shifted to paid providers.


Tech professionals: India could create up to 1.2 million incremental jobs for tech professionals by 2030. We estimate higher global spending on technology products and services by consumers and businesses to the tune of $1.7 trillion to $2 trillion by 2030. This could create demand for 20 million to 46 million incremental tech workers globally—from software engineers and electrical engineers to web developers and non-technology support staff. The largest share of global tech jobs will land in China and India.


The jobs of the future will not materialize without actions to sustain high growth. India will need a vibrant private sector to start and scale up businesses, if it is to create gainful jobs with the income-earning potential that its people desperately need. Policymakers will have to work with the private sector to stimulate investment, through strategies tailored for various sectors of the economy. The greatest focus will have to be on sectors that enable India’s labour force to transition out of agriculture, to jobs in construction, transport, trade, hospitality, healthcare, education and even manufacturing.


To attract investment, India needs to double down on creating public goods that support investments in key sectors, for example, industrial clusters with tailored infrastructure for clusters of businesses in manufacturing, financial services, education, medical services, or technology. One way is to accelerate Sagarmala, the port-based industrialization project, that envisages 14 coastal economic zones, or production clusters, with affordable housing, connected to ports and the hinterland through an efficient multimodal logistics networks, and with an enabling regulatory framework. A similar approach can work for tourism: creating circuits of tourist attractions, supplemented by hotels, restaurants, and recreational activities, connected by road, rail, and air links with reliable power, water and sanitation, and local workers trained to meet tourists’ demand for goods and services. Bold approaches would be required to implement such clusters and circuits—for example through special-purpose vehicles empowered to cut through government silos and accountable for specific outcomes.


But even assuming the jobs are there, will India’s workforce be equipped to perform them? The jobs of the future will be more skill-intensive. The need for functional digital literacy will increase across the board. For example, delivery persons need to use apps to navigate their way around the city, and shop-floor workers will need to manage precision control systems. Automation will also spur growth in demand for higher cognitive skills, particularly critical thinking, creativity, and complex information processing. Demand for social and emotional skills, such as communication and empathy, will grow almost as fast as cognitive skills, and workplaces will become more diverse as different profiles of talent come on-board. Demand for physical and manual skills will decline, although these will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030. Individuals will need to constantly learn and relearn marketable new skills throughout their life time—a critical and central challenge.",1

The Bharatiya Janata Party swept all three seats in the 2014 general election, but may find the going a little tougher this time as voter apathy remains an issue even as citizens complain about the deteriorating infrastructure.

From civic and municipal issues, corruption and traffic to subjects such as Aadhaar, privacy and individual data leaks, there’s little that citizens of India’s Silicon Valley do not discuss, debate, and plan to disrupt on social media.


As Bengaluru goes to the hustings this week, its residents share a sense of cautious optimism.

Improving pricing at a time when load factors have dropped suggests that the quality of air traffic has improved


MUMBAI: Indian airlines’ operating profits were expected to nosedive in the December quarter. Not only were fuel prices far higher, but even passenger load factors had fallen owing to unusually high capacity addition.


Analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd had anticipated Ebitda losses for all three publicly traded airlines—InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (which operates IndiGo), SpiceJet Ltd and Jet Airways (India) Ltd. Kotak Institutional Equities, which only tracks InterGlobe Aviation, had estimated losses for the market leader, which is as good as saying all Indian airlines would post losses.


But as it turns out, not only IndiGo, but even SpiceJet reported positive Ebitda. While analysts at ICICI Securities were expecting Ebitda losses of 5-6% of revenue for IndiGo and SpiceJet, they reported Ebitda of 2.8% and 4.6% of revenue, respectively. Of course, this still represents a sharp drop from the year-ago Ebitda of the two airlines.

When the price is stable, there’s criticism that it isn’t something people should invest in because it’s not increasing in value. Ultimately, it’s important for consumers to do their research and have a long-term view. Crypto currencies are an emergent high-risk asset class that could have profound utility if they gain greater adoption. As more people use them, they may become more valuable as a store of value and medium of exchange. Bitcoin has been called digital gold because of its specific properties. It is counterfeit proof, fungible, easily divisible, purely digital (which is highly useful for a more globalised economy) and it is scarce.",1

"The administration of President Donald Trump is escalating a fight with a formidable adversary – a face-off that intelligence and cybersecurity officials say has significant implications for the safety and security of the US and its allies. (Bloomberg)


Huawei’s equipment has helped some two dozen US telecom companies provide landlines, mobile services and high-speed data to many of the poorest and most remote areas in the US


In the sparsely settled wildlands of eastern Oregon, Huawei Technologies Co. is hardly the big bad wolf of China that US officials have depicted. It’s a lifeline to the 21st Century.


China’s largest tech company makes high-quality networking gear that it sells to rural telecommunications operators for 20% to 30% less than its competitors do, says Joseph Franell, chief executive officer and general manager of Eastern Oregon Telecom in Hermiston, a watermelon-growing hub of 18,000 people. Huawei’s equipment has helped some two dozen US telecom companies provide landlines, mobile services and high-speed data to many of the poorest and most remote areas in the country. Some of these companies have received federal subsidies, but not Franell’s, which was spun out to senior management last year by the electric cooperative that founded it in 1999. Huawei makes the magic happen.


“Their equipment is very, very good,"" says Franell, who chairs the Oregon legislature’s Broadband Advisory Council. “We haven’t found equivalent equipment on the market.""


The administration of President Donald Trump is escalating a fight with a formidable adversary – a face-off that intelligence and cybersecurity officials say has significant implications for the safety and security of the US and its allies. Huawei has become a world leader in manufacturing networking equipment and is striving to dominate the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G. The Trump administration, convinced Huawei is a Trojan horse for Chinese intelligence, is determined to blunt its growing sales and influence. The heightening tension, which is said to include a potential presidential order that won’t name Huawei but would greatly limit its and other companies’ US business opportunities, stems from a fundamental hardening of US policy toward China that took place in 2017 during Trump’s first year in office.


For a decade, US officials have said Huawei may be acting as an arm of the Chinese state, a private company in name only whose ulterior mission, they claim, is to steal government and corporate secrets through conventional espionage and back-door bugs in its telecom gear. The Obama administration stopped Huawei from acquiring US technology assets and exerted pressure that reportedly helped nix a $5 billion equipment deal with Sprint that would have saved the struggling US carrier $800 million in its first year. Last summer, Congress barred federal agencies and contractors from buying Chinese networking gear, and now the Trump administration is preparing an executive order that could significantly restrict all Chinese telecom sales in the US, two people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.


Through it all, Huawei has prospered. The company garners about half its annual revenue of $92 billion outside China, led by Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where cutting-edge technology at affordable prices has endeared the Chinese company to budget-strapped purchasers. Huawei has also become the world’s second-biggest mobile-phone maker, after Samsung Electronics Co. and ahead of Apple Inc. In the US, however, the consumer market has effectively closed for Huawei. Last year, Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. said they would no longer carry Huawei smartphones because of government pressure, after the FBI, CIA and NSA had warned that the phones were unsafe.


Huawei, for its part, has repeatedly denied any kind of spying or even talking with the Chinese government, let alone acting on its behalf. Executives insist it is a private company, owned by employees, not the state.",1

But the energy launch was seen as a step away from that, particularly as it came after Coke spent $5.1 billion buying the Costa coffee chain in August.


“I think the opportunity has passed, that Coke won’t buy them now,"" said Kenneth Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Monster hit a home run when it signed Coke as a distributor, but there’s a real risk that Coke’s energy line disrupts a really strong partnership, and that it slows Monster internationally.""",3

"The Rajkot-Porbandar Express is cheap and fast, but it’s also overcrowded and desperately in need of new coaches. (Varun Sood)


Hundreds of ordinary citizens travel between Rajkot and Porbandar, two busy economic hubs, for personal and professional reasons every day


Indian Railways is rightfully considered the lifeline of the country. So you’ll agree that as India celebrates the 150th birth anniversary of Mohandas K Gandhi — kicking off a two-year period of celebration in 2018 — there cannot be a more fitting tribute to one of the world’s greatest leaders than to offer hundreds of people the option to travel in clean and comfortable coaches on a route that he took in 1915, when he returned from South Africa. This certainly will trump some of the other initiatives such as the launch of stamps and the compilation of an anthology to commemorate the life of Gandhi.


Back in 1915, as you know, Gandhi travelled along this route in a third class railway carriage, as part of attempt to reacquaint himself with a country he’d left nearly two decades earlier. He started his journey in Pune, or Poona as it was known then, and then travelled this route.


Today, the train that connects the cities is No. 19572 or the Porbandar-Rajkot Express, which covers the 180 kilometres between them in four hours and 45 minutes. Let me explain why this train needs a complete overhaul.",0

Then they will call the target, pretending to be a customer care executive from the operator, in the name of upgrading to new services. They will ask the target to share their SIM card’s ICCID (integrated circuit card identifier) number—a 19-20 digit serial number specific to the SIM.

Cyberattackers may be able to exploit memory implants to steal, spy on, alter or control human memories


If you have watched Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet get their memories of each other erased in the 2004 sci-fi movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, only to ironically fall in love with each other again, or the Netflix anthology series Black Mirror, you may have asked yourself whether today’s technology is advanced enough to manipulate the human brain and even alter memories.


The answer is yes. More than five years back, neuroscientists at the Riken-MIT Center for Neural Circuit Genetics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) demonstrated that they could plant false memories in the brains of mice. While painful memories could be erased with this technology, unscrupulous people could use it to implant false memories and brainwash a whole population.",1

However, experts at Mozilla could not determine if the toy actually uses encryption of any kind.

"Around one-third of Odisha youth are migrating for economic and employment opportunities. Odisha has a natural advantage. It has four major factors for economic growth—minerals, power, a coastline, and petrochemical recycling. Its coastline gives access to the eastern part of the world. For Odisha’s growth, we need trained human resources and if we can train those who are going out, it will be better. To a large extent, the plumbers of India are from Odisha. Now, plumbing does not mean, only sanitary connection to the houses. Gas pipeline connection is growing and will be available across 400 districts soon. Gas line plumbing is a new opportunity. Drip irrigation and industrial pipelines also provide opportunities if you can acquire some extra skills. Odias are good in English and we can tap the service sector better. Similarly, Europe and the Middle East need drivers, we can upskill our people and tap that market to boost the remittance economy of the state.


You spoke about double-engine government. What are the three things that will help BJP stage an upset in Odisha?


We will stage an upset. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a lot of credibility in the state. Odisha is a laboratory of Modi’s pro-poor programmes. Houses, LPG connections, toilets and electricity connections have been provided to the poor. The things helping BJP are PM Modi, the credibility crisis of Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, the anti-incumbency due to 19 years of misrule by the BJD, and the growth in BJP’s organizational capacity in the last five years. Five years ago, our party president Amit Shahhad said Odisha is a priority and he has helped expand our capacity in the state.

The form carries a unique alphanumerical number and can be purchased from the State Bank of India.

"“As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,"" Facebook said in a statement.


In many countries, people often rely on only one or two text messaging services. In China, WeChat, which is made by Tencent, is popular, while WhatsApp is heavily used in South America. But Americans are fragmented across multiple services, like Apple’s iMessage, SMS and various Google chat apps.


For Facebook, the changes provide a better chance at making money from Instagram and WhatsApp, which currently generate little revenue even though they have vast numbers of users. Instagram has 1 billion monthly active users, while WhatsApp has 1.5 billion.


Zuckerberg does not yet have specific plans for how to profit from the integration of the services, said two of the people. But a more engaged audience could lead to new forms of advertising or other services for which Facebook could charge a fee, they said.


One business opportunity involves behavior around Facebook Marketplace, a free Craigslist-like product where people can buy and sell goods on the social network. The service has grown popular in Southeast Asia and other markets outside the United States.


When the apps are knitted together, Facebook Marketplace buyers and sellers in Southeast Asia would be able to reach out and communicate with each other using WhatsApp — which is popular there — rather than using Facebook Messenger or another, non-Facebook text messaging service. Eventually, that could lead to new ad opportunities or services for profit, said one of the people.",1

"Imagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before you’d friended a single person. That’s TikTok.


Its mode of creation is unusual, too. You can make stuff for your friends, or in response to your friends, sure. But users looking for something to post about are immediately recruited into group challenges, or hashtags, or shown popular songs. The bar is low. The stakes are low. Large audiences feel within reach, and smaller ones are easy to find, even if you’re just messing around.


On most social networks the first step to showing your content to a lot of people is grinding to build an audience, or having lots of friends, or being incredibly beautiful or wealthy or idle and willing to display that, or getting lucky or striking viral gold. TikTok instead encourages users to jump from audience to audience, trend to trend, creating something like simulated temporary friend groups, who get together to do friend-group things: to share an inside joke; to riff on a song; to talk idly and aimlessly about whatever is in front of you. Feedback is instant and frequently abundant; virality has a stiff tailwind. Stimulation is constant. There is an unmistakable sense that you’re using something that’s expanding in every direction. The pool of content is enormous. Most of it is meaningless. Some of it becomes popular, and some is great, and some gets to be both. As The Atlantic’s Taylor Lorenz put it, “Watching too many in a row can feel like you’re about to have a brain freeze. They’re incredibly addictive.""


In 1994, artist and software developer Karl Sims demonstrated “virtual creatures"" that moved in realistic ways discovered through “genetic algorithms."" These simulations, through trial and error, gradually arrived at some pre-existing shapes and movements: wriggling, slithering, dragging and walking.


But some early models, which emphasized the creatures’ ability to cover a certain distance as quickly as possible, resulted in the evolution of a very tall, rigid being that simply fell over. In doing so, it “moved"" more quickly than a wriggling peer. It didn’t understand its evolutionary priority as “creature-like locomotion."" It needed to get to a certain place as efficiently as possible. And it did.


Older social apps are continuously evolving, too. Their models prioritize growth and discovery, of course, but also assume the centrality of your people: the accounts you follow and which follow you, or with whom you communicate directly, and are bound up in their founding myths and structures: Facebook’s social graph; the News Feed; the Instagram feed; Twitter’s rigid user relationships.


TikTok though is the towering stick falling far and fast, not caring to wait to evolve through a wriggling, cumbersome social phase, but instead asking: Why not just start showing people things and see what they do about it? Why not just ask people to start making things and see what happens? If engagement is how success is measured, why not just design the app where taking up time is the entire point? There’s no rule, in apps or elsewhere, against engagement for engagement’s sake. Let the creature grow tall and fall upon us all.


TikTok is far from an evolutionary fluke. Its parent company, ByteDance, recently valued at more than $75 billion, bills itself first as an artificial intelligence company, not a creator of mission-driven social platforms. TikTok was merged with Musical.ly, a social network initially built around lip-syncing and dancing and adopted by very young people. It still carries a lot of Musical.ly’s DNA, and its app store reviews contain more than a little yearning for Musical.ly’s return. It was the defunct Musical.ly against which the Federal Trade Commission recently levied its largest-ever penalty for mishandling the private data of young users.",1

"IT major Infosys reported a mixed bag of fourth quarter numbers, with margins coming in below expectations even as revenues came in-line. Infosys also reported strong large deal wins during the quarter which came in more than $1.5 billion. Infosys’ guidance for this fiscal starting April 1, 2019, came in below the Street’s estimates. Infosys shares fell as much as 5% in early trade before closing 3% lower. Infosys' bigger rival TCS, which also reported Q4 earnings on Friday, jumped 5% today.


Coming back to Infosys' fourth quarter numbers, the company reported strong 2.1% sequential rise in constant-currency revenue, underscoring strong execution and strong order inflows. This is the second successive quarter where Infosys has achieved more than 10% growth year-on-year in constant currency. The Bengaluru-based company said it signed large deals of $1.57 billion during the quarter, taking the cumulative size of deals won to $6.28 billion for the full year. This is twice that of FY18.


In this context, many analysts say that the growth momentum, which picked up in FY19 will continue in FY20. So, they view Infosys’ guidance of 7.5-9.5% growth in constant currency terms as conservative.


“We believe the IT major is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, which is slightly below what we were expecting (8-10%),"" Reliance Securities said in a note.",3

In terms of performance upgrade, Intel’s tests suggest up to 11% more frames per second (FPS) in games such as Conquerors Blade and Total War: Warhammer II. The new chipsets support refresh rates of up to 220fps, which means a smoother gaming experience.

"The integration is only between the messaging services of the three social media platforms, but they will continue to exist and operate separately as they do at present. This new development will only allow users to send messages to a WhatsApp friend or group using Instagram Direct—the messaging service built inside Instagram—or Facebook Messenger and vice versa. This means features within WhatsApp such as unified payments interface will not be accessible from Messenger. Similarly, features of Messenger such as games will not be available on WhatsApp.


WhatsApp’s friend community largely revolves around users’ phone contacts, while Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct are linked to users’ profile and friends. So, if WhatsApp users don’t have contact details of their Facebook or Instagram friends, they cannot chat with them on WhatsApp and will have to go to their respective messaging platforms. The integration will let them chat with their wider social network from any one of the three platforms. It will also make forwarding links and messages simpler. At present, they have to copy and paste messages from one platform’s chat window to another.",1

Newer mobile games, on the other hand, run on gestures, tilting your phone or touch inputs. Hence, reinvented classic games will eventually have to drop their original styles and adapt to platforms like mobile phones, augmented reality and virtual reality.


“In the future, these games will continually get re-imagined in different ways and through different variants. We are living in this age where games are getting picked up, re-mixed, released and as soon as the new platform comes up such as Augmented Reality, you will see the same game adapted for it,"" says Jones of Bombay Play.

"Honeypots are designed to purposely engage and deceive hackers and identify malicious activities performed over the internet. Multiple honeypots can be set on a network to form a honeynet.


When cybercriminals start interacting with the device, they trigger alarms to alert a business or individual to their presence and track their activity. While there are many types of honeypots, Sophos used low-interaction honeypots (a honeypot which, once found by the hacker, will not be of much use to hackers) and high-interaction honeypots (ones that permit the attacker to go further in order to gather additional information about their intentions) for this study.


The honeypots in this study simulated the Secure Shell (SSH) service and, therefore, measured SSH login attempts. SSH is a remote access service used not only by servers, but is also enabled in domestic environments in devices as diverse as CCTV cameras or NAS (network access storage) devices.


Sophos initially set up honeypots in 10 of the most popular Amazon Web Service (AWS) data centers in the world and made sure that the honeypots are not affiliated with Sophos or any other company other than, perhaps, the hosting provider.

At the heart of the camera is a 1-inch MOS sensor with a resolution of 20MP and minimum luminance of 10 Lux, which promises good low light photography. ISO goes all the way up to 25,000 (which is not of much use, to be honest) and all the way down to 80. The camera is also capable of producing RAW copies of images.


Other features include WiFi and Bluetooth support, which allow you to connect your smartphone via Leica Image Shuttle app available on Android and iOS.


The 1-inch sensor does very well in daylight, consistently clicking good shots—be it Auto mode or manual mode (the latter takes a bit of getting used to if you’re a DSLR user).

Here are a few smartphones that can run the most popular FPS on the Play Store without breaking the bank


PUBG mobilePUBGPUBG smartphones under Rs 20000smartphones under Rs 15000Poco F1Xiaomiredmi note 5 ProMi A2Honor Playrealme U1Realme 1


The weekend’s here—the perfect time to take out your smartphones, invite a few friends online and start playing PUBG. But is that two-year-old metal slab good enough to win you the Chicken Dinner? If not, here are a few smartphones that can run the most popular FPS on the Play Store without breaking the bank.


This smartphone has “Play"" in its name, so it ought to mean business. Keeping that aside, the smartphone comes with the second best chipset Huawei has to offer, the very same one on its top tier smartphone P20 Pro—Kirin 970. Paired with this is up to 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage which can further be expanded up to 256GB via a MicroSD card. And although it doesn’t have any tricks to keep it cool, it can run PUBG on its best settings without any frame drops or heating tantrums. It also has a fairly premium yet understated design and decent AI-powered cameras.


The only thing we dislike about this phone is its UI, which lacks an app drawer and has childish icons. Slap on a launcher and you’re good to go.


The flagship killer of 2018 recently received a ₹ 1,000 price cut, so the 6GB RAM/64GB internal storage now sells for ₹ 19,999, making it the cheapest smartphone to run a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. There’s not a lot to not like about this phone—it has the fastest processor Qualcomm has to offer, some thermal trickery to keep your smartphone cool during intense gaming sessions, a very good camera and some durable plastic that doesn’t shatter or pick up scratches. And don’t forget this is the very smartphone that finished second in MKBHD’s blindfolded photo test.",1

"An industry veteran who wished to remain anonymous further added that Chinese brands have been known to even sell phones at a loss, just to gain consumer interest.


Kapal Pansari, director of Rashi Peripherals, one of India’s top five IT distributors, also said that Chinese firms gamed the distribution ecosystem well, even while treating both offline and online channels on an equal footing. He said, “Indian players did not manage distribution hygiene properly and created discontent and mistrust among its distribution stakeholders. Chinese brands, on the other hand, continued to improve on the channel front with new experiments, and introduced innovative channel finance models in order to build trust among the involved partners.""


S.N. Rai, co-founder of Lava, further added that the Chinese brands also had control over the value-chain of the business – the design and manufacturing side. While Rai claims that Lava also had control over such aspects of the business in India, the Chinese were more evolved.


However, as any disruptor in any industry knows, technological advantages do not last forever and cash burn is not a long-term strategy. That is why Indian brands have begun to sense the possibility of a comeback. According to Sethia, the likes of Oppo and Vivo have stopped paying for putting up their boards, and other such advertising tactics.


Rai from Lava said that distributors have been asking the company for products, “now that Oppo is struggling.""


Sethia currently runs distribution for Tecno, a brand owned by Transsion—the fifth largest smartphone seller in India by shipment. He previously worked with Oppo and Vivo devices. He explains that while Xiaomi is the top brand in India, it is still quite weak in terms of distribution channels.


There are rumours floating around in industry circles that Xiaomi executives had met with Micromax to buy out its once-strong retail presence, and use that to its advantage.


The concept of “preferred"" or “exclusive"" retailers is also dying, said Sethia. In this, brands like Oppo, Vivo and others would prioritise shipments to retailers who chose to sell only their products, and incentives would also differ.


Lava’s Rai also said, “Today, what we can produce at $1.3 assembly cost, Foxconn can’t produce at even $2.8, despite having such huge volumes."" He cited increasing costs in China as a reason, and added that China’s support program for ‘low-value add manufacturing’ is moving away, because they find it to be hindering their economy.


The company, today, thinks it’s at par with any global manufacturer, and the government’s Phased Manufacturing Programme, which has a mix of import tariffs and incentives for local assembly, will help them as well. Besides, while Indian brands have lost their dominance within India, they are still selling phones in other countries, like Mexico.",1

Soros, 88, has been a frequent detractor of Facebook, calling it a “menace"" earlier this year.


Facebook issued a lengthy rebuttal to the story Thursday, denying that it asked Definers to pay for or write articles on its behalf or pushed journalists to spread misinformation. Without naming Soros, a Hungarian-born Holocaust-survivor, the company said its actions weren’t aimed at fuelling anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Rather, it said it encouraged reporters to look into the funding of anti-Facebook groups, most notably Freedom From Facebook, ‘to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company.’


A longtime financial backer of Democratic causes and politicians, Soros is a favourite bogeyman of the right wing, which accuses him of anti-American plots. Last month, a suspected bomb was discovered in the mail of his New York home, the first of a dozen sent to Democratic and liberal figures including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.


Patrick Gaspard, the foundation’s president, called the use of Soros, ‘reprehensible’ in a letter to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.

"The notch, one of the biggest compromises in the smartphone industry ushered in by Apple’s iPhone X, is present on all three smartphones. The main reason to do so is to spread out the display to the edges as much as possible. This eliminates the chin and forehead of a smartphone to an extent, giving it an eyebrow instead.


All three phones also come with LCD displays featuring an aspect ratio of 19:9, providing more vertical screen real estate in a factor that’s not uncomfortable to grip in your palm.


The Realme 2 has the biggest screen of the lot, sizing in at 6.2-inches horizontally with a resolution of 1520x720 pixels. The Redmi 6 Pro and Honor 9N feature identical screens measuring 5.84-inches horizontally with a resolution of 2280x1080.


The pixel density, however, is the lowest in the Realme 2—at 271 ppi. That is because of low resolution on a large screen, which in turn compromises the crispness of the display. The other two phones come with the same density of 432 ppi and are sufficiently crisp for consuming visual content.


All three phones in the shootout come with different processors—all with eight cores. Starting with the most powerful of the lot, the Honor 9N features the in-house HiSilicon Kirin 659 processor, with four cores clocked at 2.36GHz and the other four at 1.7GHz.

The BJP’s campaign will focus not just on the policy work of the government, but also on its promises for the future. The party is expected to release its manifesto on Monday.


“Our theme is the culmination of the work done by the five-year government. It will be multi-modal. The first theme is a government that works. The second theme is an honest government. The third is that it is a government which holds the capabilities of taking big decisions when it comes to development and national security,"" union finance minister Arun Jaitley said, while addressing a press conference in the national capital.",0
"Although the BJP has never played a decisive role in West Bengal politics, it has managed to maintain a fairly steady vote share for itself over the last six general elections—even when it did not win a seat.


In 2014, the party managed 17% of the votes and two Lok Sabha seats, up from a vote share of 6% and one seat in 2009. In the 2016 assembly polls, however, it only managed to win three seats but the absence of a credible opposition to the TMC in West Bengal has given the BJP a chance in this general election. The Congress and the Left Front have been losing support steadily in the state over the last few years.


“Our entire support is for Mamata didi,"" said Imran, who owns a leather business in Kolkata’s Park Circus. “She is responsible for Hindu-Muslim unity in West Bengal. There have always been differences between the majority and minority communities here, but didi knows how to handle it. She maintains peace and works for the development of West Bengal.""


The TMC is assured of the support of minorities — 27% of the state’s population is Muslim and 7% Christian — in the fight against the growing popularity and influence of the BJP under Modi.


The fact that she is part of a massive opposition alliance does play against her with some voters. “Mamata Banerjee can become the prime minister but there are 21 parties (in the alliance), so she will not get more than six months in the seat. India needs a strong and stable government and a prime minister for five years. The opposition parties have not presented a credible PM candidate this time,"" said Pratap Shankar Das, a 62-year-old consultant and a resident of Serampore.",0

According to senior party leaders from the state, though Priyanka Gandhi has been assigned Uttar Pradesh with an eye on improving the party's prospects in the state in the long run, her immediate challenge will be to enthuse the party cadre and effective ticket distribution.

"The unit allows connectivity with multiple devices at a time, which a great thing. It also comes with a fast charging USB port at an unfortunate position at the top left corner. I have mixed feelings about this, as the charging cable forms the loop over the volume up and down buttons which I happened to use a lot.


The Smart Sync app consists of several layers of customisability. The default setup on the home screen allows you to view the track currently playing, Google Maps (in case you’ve enabled navigation), time and date and a speedometer that also tells you the altitude.


You can interact with the app either by using your phone’s screen or by pressing any one of four physical buttons present on the unit. You can also change your audio source and trigger the home screen of the app with the two buttons present on the edges of the unit.


While Pioneer claims you can select the app of your choice for actions like playing music and reading out messages, I found it fairly limited. For instance, it didn’t support Wynk Music, so I ended up pulling down the notification tray everytime I had to change the song.


It does allow WhatsApp messages to be read out if you tap the “message"" button on the head unit something that I found really useful.


When you start digging further in the settings, you’ll find a really cool presentation of EQ and the ability to accurately pick the direction of sound using the fader and setting. It also supports FLAC audio for the audiophile inside you.

"Experts often complain that one of the limitations of India’s economic policy making has been complete disregard for data-backed evidence for better understanding of ground realities. A survey conducted in rural Bihar by a World Bank economist and two professors from the Georgetown University to gauge the response of poor people on the raging debate over a minimum income support scheme showed that the poor preferred better public healthcare and road services over direct cash transfers.


The survey conducted by Stuti Khemani, senior economist at the World Bank, and professors at the Georgetown University James Habyarimana and Irfan Nooruddin, of around 3,800 respondents over November-December last year showed only 13% chose cash if it came at the expense of spending to improve public health and nutrition, while the number grew to only 35% if the cash came at the expense of improving roads.


Data from the survey also suggests that there isn’t much political demand for minimum income programmes. When village-level politicians were asked which area of performance or service delivery would be most important for them to get elected or re-elected, only 4% mentioned the rural job guarantee scheme MGNREGS. The largest number of village politicians, 35%, mentioned “maintaining social harmony,"" with the rest scattered across health (14%), education (14%), roads (15%), and water and sewage (15%).",0

"Rakesh Kumar, an analyst at Elara Capital, said: “Allahabad Bank, Corporation Bank and Central Bank (in order of preference) have highest probability of getting out of the PCA scheme, provided these banks get additional equity capital infusion.""


Allahabad Bank has the lowest net NPA ratio and a decent capital adequacy ratio. Corporation Bank has an enviable Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9%, but bringing down 11% of its net NPAs to the required 6%, would risk burning down the entire capital in excess of the regulatory minimum. It would get the bank out of the PCA framework, but its balance sheet would be emaciated.


Therefore, it all boils down to the amount of capital the government is willing to infuse in these banks. IDBI Bank Ltd’s management had recently said that it was hopeful of exiting PCA by September. However, it has the biggest net NPA ratio of 14% and the nearly 10% common equity capital will not be enough to burn. Perhaps, IDBI Bank, too, is banking on the largesse lenders such as Bank of India has enjoyed.",3

The boost Priyanka Gandhi brings to the Congress campaign may not turn the tide against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, polls show


Congress support in Uttar Pradesh has dropped off after jumping 10 percentage points on news that Priyanka Gandhi had taken a party post


Ayodhya: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra became the latest member of India's storied Nehru-Gandhi dynasty to enter politics in January, but the boost she brings tthe Congress campaign may not turn the tide against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, polls show.


After years of speculation, the charismatic Priyanka Gandhi joined Congress to help its leader, her brother Rahul Gandhi, in general elections that begin next week, pitching the party and regional groups against Modi's Hindu nationalist-led alliance.

Vietnam’s controversial version went into effect Jan. 1 -- a law BSA/The Software Alliance, which counts Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. among its members -- called chilling and ineffectual. Indonesia, the region’s largest economy, already requires data be stored locally. The Philippines has stepped up what critics call a media crackdown, arrested the head of media outlet Rappler Inc. after it grew critical of President Rodrigo Duterte. And last year, the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak introduced a fake news law used to probe his chief opponent, though the current government may yet repeal it.


One of the latest to buy into the rationale is Thailand, which on Feb. 28 passed a cyber security bill modeled on China’s that grants the government the right to seize data and electronic equipment without a court order in the interests of national security. Introduced just weeks ahead of Thailand’s first democratic election since a 2014 military coup, it stoked concerns it could be used to stifle dissent, though the government says it shouldn’t affect companies “with good conduct."" The Asia Internet Coalition, an organization that groups the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., condemned a bill Amnesty International warns could be used to “cage the internet.""

Sometimes Amazon scoops up data by default.

More recently, the company has started using the shipping address associated with a customer’s account as the Echo’s default location.

"Facebook wants to encourage small numbers of individuals to carry on encrypted conversations that no one can read


San Francisco: After building a social network that turned into a surveillance system, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he's shifting his company's focus to messaging services designed to serve as fortresses of privacy.


Instead of just being the network that connects everyone, Facebook wants to encourage small numbers of individuals to carry on encrypted conversations that neither Facebook nor any other outsider can read.


It also plans to let messages automatically disappear, a feature pioneered by its rival Snapchat that could limit the risks posed by a trail of social media posts that follow people throughout their lives.


It's a major bet by Zuckerberg, who sees it as a way to push Facebook more firmly into a messaging market that's growing faster than its main social networking business.

"Many economists find that automation has an overall positive effect on the labour market, said Matias Cortes, an assistant professor at York University in Toronto who was not involved with the Brookings report.

But Cortes said there's no doubt there are ""clear winners and losers."" In the recent past, those hardest hit were men with low levels of education who dominated manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs, and women with intermediate levels of education who dominated clerical and administrative positions.


In the future, the class of workers affected by automation could grow as machines become more intelligent. The Brookings report analyzed each occupation's automation potential based on research by the McKinsey management consulting firm. Those jobs that remain largely unscathed will be those requiring not just advanced education, but also interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence.

"What good is lowering the price of money if its availability remains doubtful. When the risk-free sovereign bond yield has climbed, riskier corporate bond yields will follow. Considering that deposit growth has remained far lower than credit growth, banks are unlikely to cut loan rates and forgo margins, especially when they cannot afford to antagonize depositors by cutting rates for them.


Another reason to doubt rates are heading south is RBI’s own assumptions. Governor Das said the central bank has considered budgeted fiscal deficit numbers in its inflation and growth forecasts. State finances are in a precarious position and the central government has missed fiscal deficit targets more times than it has met them in the past. Market participants are wary of fiscal slippages given the elections this year.


If RBI wants markets to believe that it was willing to lend a hand to growth, it would have to go beyond rate cuts and unclog the liquidity flow. It will also have to take the government’s accounts with a pinch of salt.",3

The scenario, however, is evolving and it is to be seen how much the firm can actually pass on. This is especially because Sebi has banned upfront commissions and a substantially lower TER reduces distributor margins. This may not be taken too well by distributors. Last year, though, some TER changes were passed on to distributors.",3

"In January 2018, the Shiv Sena national executive passed a resolution saying the party would contest all future elections on its own. Thackeray and Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana routinely launched broadsides against the Narendra Modi government, going to the extent of endorsing Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s “chowkidar chor hain"" refrain against the prime minister.


The BJP-Shiv Sena tie-up is India’s second oldest alliance after the Left coalition that ruled West Bengal for more than three decades. The saffron parties formalized their alliance in 1989 in an astute acknowledgement of changing sociopolitical dynamic in Maharashtra.


By the late 80s, the Shiv Sena, founded in 1966, realized the limitations to its son-of-the-soil politics as demographics in Maharashtra had changed. Meanwhile, nationally, the BJP leveraged the Hindutva card and emerged as an alternative to the Congress.


Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray reckoned that an alliance with the BJP would bring the non-Marathi votes into the saffron fold. The BJP saw the electoral merit in ensuring support of Marathi voters in Maharashtra through the Shiv Sena.


In 1995, the alliance won power in Maharashtra for the first time, though the Shiv Sena was the actual big brother—winning more seats and electing its own chief minister.",0

"So on 20 March, Beresheet will fly beyond the moon on its elongated earth orbit. By then, the craft will feel the moon’s gravity more strongly than the earth’s, and so we can say its lunar capture is effectively underway. By 4 April, it will be in a tight orbit around the moon. A week later, on 11 April, Beresheet will actually attempt to land on the moon, an exercise that should take about 20 nerve-wracking minutes. Not least because it will be in free-fall for the final few metres. If it does successfully land, it will be the first privately funded spacecraft—and Israel just the fourth country—to achieve that feat.


Once on moon ground, Beresheet will seek to learn something about our neighbour’s magnetic field. Moon rocks that the Apollo missions brought back were magnetized: how did that come about? An interesting puzzle, but really, everything about this effort is impressive. You could even say the length of the mission showcases exactly that. For as we follow the little spacecraft’s convoluted path to the moon, we actually see all the required science and mathematics turn into reality: the orbits, the capture, all of it.


And that’s probably why another of SpaceIL’s co-founders, Kfir Damari, said this about their mission: “Our goal is to show (children) that (space flight is) not magic—it’s something they can understand. If they can understand that, and if they can meet engineers and hear their story and see that they come from all different kinds of backgrounds, they can understand that they themselves can be those who will build the next spacecraft.""


Beresheet won’t be bringing back moon rocks—in fact, it won’t be returning to earth at all. But what it stimulates here on earth might be even more valuable than rocks.

"Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s March quarter profit margins hit the skids as the two-wheeler manufacturer pushed sales to correct a high inventory pile. Ebitda margins in the March quarter dropped by 240 basis points to 13.6% from the year-ago period. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.


Margins were punctured primarily because of weak operating leverage, as two-wheeler sales dropped by 11% year-on-year. While motorcycle sales fell by about 9%, scooter sales plunged 32% during the quarter. Therefore, raw material and inventory costs together, as a percentage of sales, rose by 140 basis points, while employee costs increased by 130 basis points compared to the year-ago period. Besides, the company pushed sales, especially in March, through promotional schemes, which also impacted profit margins. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.",3
"Experts however feel that a long protracted schedule for some of the states could influence voters with campaigning on in neighbouring areas as well as impact the ‘level playing ground’ tenet which is enforced by the Model Code of Conduct (MCC).


“Staggered elections lead to information asymmetry which can be used by political parties to gain information on voter behavior from the earlier phases. Three states are spread over seven phases. Political parties in general will have a peek in voter behavior which can influence voters. This works against the basic tenet of free and fair elections,"" said Manisha Priyam, a New Delhi based political analyst.

And if things go awry in global oil markets, there’s risk that political blame shifts back to the U.S. for the sanctions, which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threatens economic stability.


Because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges, policy makers look to core indexes that remove volatile components. If the run-up in prices proves to be substantial, and sustained, those costs will filter through to transportation and utilities.


Led by the Federal Reserve, central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policy makers to shift their focus to slowing growth.

"Modi had spoken tough on terrorism emanating from Pakistan well before he assumed office on 26 May 2014, and subsequently too. It was, thus, expected that India would give a strong response to the Pulwama attack. This was more so as India had conducted a surgical strike, sending in army commandos to take out terrorist launch pads across the Line of Control after a terrorist strike on an Army garrison in Uri in September 2016 that claimed 19 lives. The Pulwama attack, which was claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group, in comparison was bloodier with a higher toll.


Analysts say the Modi government has set a new bar in dealing with terrorism with the Balakot strike, marking a clear transition from the previous defensive posture to an offensive one.


In the past, “we have been reluctant to cross LoC in Jammu and Kashmir by air as we saw during the (1999) Kargil War when our Air Force was under strict orders not to do so,"" said former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal. “On land, exchanges of fire and limited incursions across the LoC have been going on for a long time.


The 2016 surgical strike in response to the Uri attack was the official announcement of a new policy decision. The Balakot air strike raises the level of our riposte much higher, especially as we have gone beyond Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and have hit interior Pakistan,"" Sibal said. With this, “we have opened up a lot of strategic space for ourselves because we have signalled our willingness to attack anywhere in Pakistan against a terrorist target. We have also overcome our concern that striking at Pakistan conventionally could escalate matters to the nuclear level.


With Balakot, we have called Pakistan’s nuclear bluff,"" he pointed out.What the Balakot strike demonstrates is the changed Indian mindset that “whereas we were willing to bear a lot of pain inflicted on us by Pakistan in the past without inflicting pain on it in return, we have now decided to hit back at Pakistan militarily to dissuade it from carrying out terrorist attacks against us"", Sibal said. “To that extent, we have moved from a defensive to an offensive posture, but we are not going on the offensive against Pakistan independently of provocations by it,"" he said.",0

"Every city may have its own andaaz, a distinct manner of getting views across, but Lucknow appeared to have mastered the art of doing so in riddles. So to say the BJP has got Uttar Pradesh will be an overstatement


The BJP is set to do well in UP’s capital. Yet, the party looks like it’s getting fewer votes in this bellwether state


Of all that has been said about Lucknow, this line has always been a puzzle: If Uttar Pradesh is the country’s pivot to power in Delhi, then this former seat of Awadhi nawabs is the cushion for a soft landing. It makes this charming old constituency sound like a hedge against the risk of losses, if not a consolation prize in a game of pass-the-parcel.


Famous for sending former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Parliament, Lucknow is still considered a “safe seat"" of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which turned it over five years ago to home minister Rajnath Singh, who won it by scoring over half a million votes—more than rival candidates from the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) combined. Singh now seems sold on a national security bounce to see off his contenders. Few would give either Acharya Pramod Krishnam of the Congress or Poonam Sinha of the SP half a chance of pulling off an upset this year.


In an election rally here on Sunday, a week before ballot booths were to be thrown open on 6 May, Singh’s gravelly voice was in rant mode against terror in general and Kashmir’s “special"" status in particular. The final authority on all matters of public safety, though, it had to be assumed, would rest with the object of people’s awe across town: Narendra Modi. Indeed, few had anything but loud praise for the Prime Minister as India’s defender-in-chief.


Whether the BJP’s micro-strategist Amit Shah actually needed to waste any time working out the math of identities and affiliations was unclear. Why would the party even bother putting the Amit Shah playbook into play here? The opposition had a two-way split anyway. In 2017, the BJP had managed to cleave Yadavs apart from worse-off other backward classes (OBCs) in the SP’s vote base, Jatavs apart from other Scheduled Castes (SCs) in the BSP’s, and Sunnis apart from Shias (who Vajpayee wooed) among Muslims. And if this wasn’t enough, the BJP had other aspects of its majoritarian brand of nationalism to rely on. Easy going, then.


Yet, it’s hard to escape the odd whisper in favour of the SP-BSP alliance forged last year with the explicit aim of ending the BJP’s dominance of Uttar Pradesh. Were a large number of BJP seats at threat? Speaking to Mint, Rajiva Sharan, a professor of political science at the University of Lucknow, declared himself “very sceptical"" about that. “My view is that SP’s Akhilesh (Yadav) and BSP’s Mayawati coming together is fine,"" he said, “but if they think their voters will vote as they instruct them (for each other’s candidates), I don’t think it’s going to work out the way they expect.""


An election or two ago, it may have happened, he added, but vote transfers couldn’t be counted upon any longer because voters had developed a political awareness of their own; SP-aligned Yadavs, for example, would likely be reluctant to vote for the BSP, while BSP-loyal SCs often saw OBCs as their exploiters. “By the arithmetic, it may look like a hands-down win for the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, but it’s not going to be easy. Till yesterday, these voters were fed on ‘our interests are inimical to each other’s’,"" added Sharan, offering a recap of the regime’s work on roads, rural electrification, gas stoves, soil cards, the Kumbh, and so on.",0

"New Delhi: Smartphones have evolved a lot since Steve Jobs first introduced the Apple iPhone with a multitouch display in 2007. Screens are much bigger now with the latest iPhone sporting a 6.5-inch screen, which allows people to use their smartphones for work and entertainment. Further, access to 4G speeds has made it easier to stream videos directly from the phone. High-density Lithium batteries have enhanced the battery backup significantly (Moto One Power’s 5,000mAh battery last up to two days). Moreover, improved sensors and artificial intelligence-powered algorithms have made phones as the default camera for many.


Now, phone makers are trying to take smartphones to the next level with foldable displays. US-based Royole Corp. has already announced a foldable screen phone called FlexPai. Early this month, Samsung demonstrated its first smartphone with a foldable screen. At IFA 2018, Huawei announced it is working on a foldable smartphone with 5G capabilities and will be launching it sometime next year. Apple, LG and Nokia have filed patents for foldable smartphones, while LG and Lenovo have showcased concept versions of rollable screens in the past. Following Samsung’s announcement, Google assured that Android OS will be tweaked to support the new form factor soon. 


But why do you need smartphones that can be folded?  In the current scenario, users can rely on their smartphone only to an extent. Even the big-screen phones such as iPhone Xs Max and Vivo Nex (6.6-inch) cannot replace a small- screen notebook or a big-screen tablet. But with foldable screens, manufacturers can accommodate bigger screens in a form factor that would fit into a pocket. For instance, FlexPai offers a 7.8-inch display that can come in handy for users who want to work, read or watch a movie on a bigger screen. For basic needs,  users can fold the phone and use one half of the screen.  Samsung’s foldable phone has a secondary 4.5-inch display on the cover in addition to the foldable screen.",1

"Millennials and post-millennial adults together account for roughly half of India’s electorate (Raj K. Raj/HT)


BJP is far more popular than the Congress and Narendra Modi far more popular than Rahul Gandhi among India’s urban millennials, the results of the second round of the YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey show


Roughly half of India’s urban millennials support the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while only a sixth favour the principal opposition party, Congress. The popularity of BJP’s top leader, Narendra Modi, is slightly more than that of his party while that of the Congress president, Rahul Gandhi is slightly less than that of his party.


These are among the striking findings of the second round of the YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey conducted in January and February this year. The survey ended before the airstrike by India on Pakistani soil and the counterattack by Pakistan, and hence does not take into account either the post-Balakot surge in support for Modi or the subsequent decline of that surge reported by other surveys. In that sense, this survey is a Balakot-free assessment of what India’s urban youth want.",0
"Immediately after the Balakot airstrikes, the Congress cancelled its much-touted 28 February Congress Working Committee meeting and mega rally in Ahmedabad, which also was to be the venue for Priyanka Gandhi’s first public address after venturing into politics. It was party president Rahul Gandhi’s big idea to take the 2019 Lok Sabha election battle to Narendra Modi’s lair. These meetings eventually did take place but after a space of a fortnight. In the meantime, the BJP silently began its poaching spree of key Congress legislators from rural areas, particularly Saurashtra.


Saurashtra used to be a BJP bastion since 1995, which was shaken for the first time in 2017. No wonder then that the ruling party in the state has begun to focus its attention on this critical region, more than 75% of which is rural and agricultural hinterland. In the last two months, key Congress leaders in areas covering as many as seven Lok Sabha seats in Saurashtra have defected.


One of the defectors, Jawahar Chavda, was inducted into the Vijay Rupani government as a cabinet minister within 24 hours of joining the BJP.


Months earlier, another senior leader from the important Koli community and a legislator from Jasdan falling under Rajkot Lok Sabha constituency, Kunvarji Bavalia, resigned from the Congress to be made a cabinet minister on the same day. In fact, as many as 34 leaders of various hues, including sitting and former legislators as well as former MPs, have switched over from the Congress to the BJP in the past five years. And a majority of them hailed from rural areas, largely Saurashtra.


Saurashtra is to Gujarat what Uttar Pradesh is to India in terms of the proportion of legislators (54 members of legislative assembly) it sends to the state assembly. But there is some churning in north Gujarat also with Congress legislator from Unjha assembly seat, Asha Patel, quitting to join the BJP. With the help of Asha Patel, once a close associate of Hardik Patel, the Congress had snatched a traditional BJP stronghold in Mehsana, the home district of the Modi-Shah duo. Another shock came for the Congress early last week when young turk and emerging OBC (other backward classes) leader Alpesh Thakore and his aide Dhavalsinh Zala, both MLAs from north Gujarat, quit the party. North Gujarat is a Patidar and OBC dominant region, with a mix of rural and semi-urban areas, where the Congress was hoping to pick up three of the four Lok Sabha seats.


The key reasons for BJP’s 2017 reversal—severe farmer distress, unemployment, and the adverse impact created due to the twin blows of demonetization and GST—are all still very much alive. Besides, with the summer setting in, water woes of the farmers in the drought-prone parts of the state would also come into play.


Ask Keshubhai in Modadaar village in Porbandar about the election and he immediately says: “There is nothing for farmers in the scheme of things under the present government. Not a single one of their promises to farmers has been fulfilled. Where is the Narmada water for irrigation or drinking?"" In the region, water trickles in once in ten days. Survival largely depends on water tankers.


“They seem to be merely mocking our situation,"" rues Hardasbhai in the nondescript Kadegi village, when asked about the ₹6,000 aid announced by the central government for all farmers. “We will get a paltry amount of ₹2,000 first. It would have been better if this was not given. We have not received adequate support prices for our groundnut and cotton crops. The government should have looked into that,"" Hardasbhai says.",0

The Vokkaligas and Lingayats are upset that Siddaramaiah took votes away from the Congress in last year’s assembly elections. The caste equations have led to situations where parties and leaders go out of their way to ensure the defeat of a candidate, irrespective of who wins. Politicians and party leaders say that the BJP and JD(S) struck an informal arrangement in last year’s elections in some seats of south Karnataka and also engineered Siddaramaiah’s defeat from his home constituency of Chamundeshwari.

A Manhattan judge announced the delay Friday after a closed-door hearing in which prosecutors sought to broaden their case to include some of those women’s accounts


Weinstein’s trial had been scheduled to begin June 3, but both sides indicated they need more time to sort through witness and evidence issues


Weinstein lawyer Jose Baez, who joined the case in January, saw the delay as a boon to a defense keen on discrediting his accusers and showing that any encounters were consensual

"New Delhi: Three years after resigning from her seat in Kashmir’s Anantnag, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s hopes were once again pinned on making a comeback in this Lok Sabha constituency. However, with disillusionment and violence gripping the state, on Tuesday, Anantnag recorded a voter turnout of 13.63% -- a factor that now keeps Mufti’s fate hanging in the balance.


However, the dismal voter turnout is not without reason. Since the 14 February suicide attack by the Jaish-e-Mohammad on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Pulwama, the chasm between the people and the government has only widened, a senior state government official argued, leading to the dismal voter turnout – first in Srinagar, last week and now in Anantnag.


“The security forces have been conducting cordon and search operations across Pulwama and Shopian. Civilians are getting caught in the crossfire as collateral damage and sometimes young boys are getting heckled for no reason.

"With Avengers: Endgame, the two-movie storyline that started with “Avengers: Infinity War” is finished, along with the 22-film cycle that represents the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date


In the three-hour span of Endgame, the Avengers confront and kill Thanos (Josh Brolin), who had used the Infinity Gauntlet to snap away half of all life in the universe


 When the story resumes five years later, the Avengers are still left with their grief and remorse — until the unexpected return of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) kicks off a race back through time to retrieve the Infinity Stones before Thanos could obtain them in the first place


 Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sacrifices her life; a colossal battle ensues; Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr


) dies; and Captain America (Chris Evans) finds a way to live the life he had always wanted, reappearing as an old man to entrust his shield to the Falcon (Anthony Mackie)


These and many other head-spinning developments in Endgame emerged from the imaginations of its screenwriters, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who also wrote Infinity War


) Markus and McFeely have been friends and collaborators since the 1990s and also wrote all three Captain America movies as well as Thor: The Dark World (with Christopher L


In a recent interview in their offices in Los Angeles, Markus and McFeely discussed the many choices and possibilities of Endgame, the roads not taken and the decisions behind who lived and who died


Q: How did you decide where the major events of Infinity War and Endgame would fall?Markus: The biggest point was probably the Snap


 And we realized fairly early on that if we didn’t do it at the end of the first movie, the first movie wasn’t going to have an end


 And if we did it too early in the first movie, it would be a bit of an anticlimax after you’ve killed half the universe to have them stumbling around for half an hour


 So the question is, is it early in the second movie? Late in the second movie? You notice the players left on the board are the OG Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye), and let’s give them their due


 So that if you were a big fan of Doctor Strange or Black Panther or Bucky (the Winter Soldier) or Sam (the Falcon), you’re only going to get a little brief window on them


Q: How did you choose which characters would survive for Endgame?Markus: We knew we wanted to see Cap and Tony dealing with the aftermath so that you could really see them suffer, quite frankly


 And that’s why Cap and Natasha are relatively minimal in the first movie, because all they’d be doing is punching


 We knew that they had a lot of story in the second movie, and there were other people who would have much more story in the first movie, like the Guardians


Q: Endgame sort of tricks you by having the heroes kill Thanos almost immediately, only to discover it doesn’t solve anything


 We were just banging our heads for weeks, and at some point, (the executive producer) Trinh Tran went, “Can’t we just kill him?” And we all went, “What happens if you just kill him? Why would you kill him? Why would he let you kill him?”Markus: It reinforced Thanos’ agenda


 Did that feel like a risk for a big-event picture?Markus: It felt less risky once I saw the reaction to “Infinity War


Q: And that theme of loss is continued when Scott Lang visits a memorial to the dead in San Francisco


Markus: It’s that sense of collective trauma and the fact that if you weren’t killed, you wake up the next day — the trauma happened and I’m still here


Q: How did you start to determine the trajectories for the heroes in Endgame?McFeely: Chris and I wrote a master document while we were shooting “Civil War,” and one of the things we were interested in exploring is, remember the What If comics? Well, this is our what if",2
"Adding to this was the delicious opportunity to easily offload long-term government bonds to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) through its open market operations (OMOs). The central bank has been one of the biggest buyers of bonds in recent months.


“RBI had done large-scale OMO operations and that had pushed yields down sharply. This sharp fall in yields has given a profit-taking opportunity. Also, when the RBI is buying, it is the best opportunity to sell,"" said R. Sivakumar, head of fixed income at Axis Asset Management Co. Ltd.


But what the selling of government bonds has done is increase the credit risk profile of debt funds even more. To their credit, mutual funds reduced their exposure to commercial papers (CPs) by over four percentage points to 10.6%, a clear move to reduce credit risk since these instruments were at the epicentre of the liquidity crisis. Recall that questions about the credit quality of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) had butchered their stocks in September, with some of them losing more than 50% of their market value. In fact, taken together, the exposure of corporate bonds and CPs hasn’t risen as much.",3

RBI lowered its growth forecast for FY20 by just a shade. Its own surveys don’t point to a big trouble with growth, as the business expectations index show an improvement. Even the order books, inventory and capacity utilization survey points to a rise in capacity utilization, albeit by a small margin.


The central bank said there is an output gap that has emerged which needs to be addressed. Perhaps, what it is also worried about is the expected fall in public capital expenditure next year, as shown by the budgeted numbers. If private investment remains lacklustre, too, revival of investment will only get more postponed. The economy can ill afford such a delay when it is finding its feet on recovery.


Of course, monetary transmission takes a long time to translate into increased demand and investment. But perhaps, RBI’s gambit of getting accommodative, at the same time when the government is putting money in the hands of consumers, will result in higher growth. The big risk of course will be whether its own subdued inflation targets will also stand.",3

"Post-Pulwama statements from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, that were not in sync with the Modi government’s narrative, were ferociously rebuked in the comment section, many with sexist overtones.


On Mufti’s statement that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan should be given another chance, the most liked comment read: “If you like him then go and marry him.""


What one classifies as “uncivil"" or “hateful"" can be subjective. Still, compared with the visible and vicious trolling on Twitter, Facebook comments are relatively clean. In fact, research suggests that “Facebook breeds less incivility overall than more anonymous spaces such as Twitter,"" political scientist Rebekah Tromble tweeted.


In some cases, the counter-narrative in the comment section serves as an antidote to baseless troll-like statements. When T. Raja Singh, the lone BJP legislator in Telangana assembly, demanded the removal of tennis star Sania Mirza as the brand ambassador of Telangana because she is a “bahu (daughter-in-law) of Pakistan"", all the top ten comments on Facebook post supported Mirza. “She is daughter of India and Idol for million of Indian girls.

Such behaviour is rare in outright partisan pages that attract ideological audiences. But even within echo chambers, there can be moments of clarity.


For example, when the wildly popular Nation with Namo page posted a heavily edited video in December 2018 to promote the fake news narrative that Rahul Gandhi walked back on the promise of loan waiver in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, one person commented: “This is fake news. I’m a supporter of BJP and Modi but this is wrongly portrayed… Don’t try to gain support by fake propaganda."" (top comment with 1,500 likes)

"The state, which has had an uneasy relationship with the mainland since the days of the late pro-independence leader Angami Zapu Phizo, is wary of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) promises because of the Naga Peace Accord, 2015, held up by slow progress of talks and the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. These, along with the aversion of the people of the Christian-majority state toward the BJP’s agenda to promote Hindutva and the uniform civil code, are the major issues in Nagaland.


The direct contest in Nagaland, where money power has fuelled political corruption, is between the ‘hand’ and the ‘globe’, the election symbols of the Congress and the NDPP, respectively. Many believe the BJP-NDPP alliance has an edge because the state tends to send the ruling party candidate to the Lok Sabha. “If you don’t have support in Delhi, any state project will run into roadblocks,"" said Kathi Chishi, secretary of Toka MPCS, an organization that provides financing for rural livelihood.


The NDPP’s candidate is Tokheho Yepthomi, the current member of parliament, who won the seat last year after Neiphiu Rio vacated it to contest the assembly elections. The Congress candidate is K.L. Chishi, former chief minister and a veteran Naga politician. Conrad Sangma’s National People’s Party has fielded a candidate, while the Naga People’s Front is backing its arch rival, the Congress, because it is against the BJP’s majoritarian Hindutva agenda and believes Congress is the party with a secular plank. An independent, M.M. Thromwa Konyak, is also in the fray. The BJP released its manifesto on Monday, restating its commitment to passing the citizenship amendment bill, which had sparked violence in the North-East. However, Yepthomi said on Friday, that after “the government is formed, the NDA partners will meet and then discuss. And what will be best for all stakeholders will be decided on that basis.""",0

"India heads into its first fully-digital national election. Is the Election Commission up to the task of policing it?


On 1 March, as Indian Air Force wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman was making his way across the border after being released by Pakistan, Om Prakash Sharma, a BJP MLA from Delhi, shared two posters on Facebook. The images, one with a jet leaving a tiranga-colored trail of smoke in its wake and the other doused in saffron, featured Varthaman alongside the smiling faces of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and—in a subordinate position—Sharma himself.


The two days that Varthaman had spent in Pakistan had been punctuated by a series of videos of him in custody, which rapidly went viral, searing his composed bravery—as well as his handlebar moustache—into the minds of millions of Indians. Sharma’s posters, which heralded Varthaman’s quick release as a strategic victory for Modi and hailed the pilot’s return, were similar to posts made by many other politicians scrambling to latch on to the pilot’s likeness to earn some quick electoral capital for their party.


A little over a week later, the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) came into effect ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, with the Election Commission of India announcing its intent to enforce it on internet platforms for the first time. The MCC is a set of guidelines that regulate elections in India, one of which cautions against using the armed forces in campaigning. Sharma’s posters became the first to be targeted under the new regime and have since been taken down.


Although the MCC has applied to internet platforms since 2013, no attempt has been made to enforce it thus far. The ECI has now announced a series of new measures, which fall into two broad categories.


The first encompasses measures designed to increase transparency in campaigning, such as verification of the identities and locations of all political advertisers, and disclosure of candidates’ social media accounts and expenditure. The second category includes norms aimed at curbing misinformation and hate speech by candidates: pre-certification of political ads by the ECI’s Media Certification and Monitoring Committee and the creation of dedicated grievance redressal channels through which the ECI can flag and takedown problematic content quickly.


But India’s online world of murky WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, some of which can be bought by the hour, has thrown up a set of unique challenges. How does one regulate a realm of smoke and mirrors where the identity of key actors and their motives is tenuous at best?


“Most of the [election-related] information flow is actually not even happening via the IT cells, but through third-party contracts. These third-parties then to a large extent are not using the paid prioritization features of platforms but are then, in turn, engaging influencers to place what are called organic posts, which game the algorithm of [online] platforms to push in much more subtle marketing messaging blended with political canvassing,"" said Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.",0

The content labeling program could raise new privacy issues for Facebook, according to legal experts consulted by Reuters. The company is facing regulatory investigations worldwide over an unrelated set of alleged privacy abuses involving the sharing of user data with business partners.


The Wipro workers said they gain a window into lives as they view a vacation photo or a post memorializing a deceased family member. Facebook acknowledged that some posts, including screenshots and those with comments, may include user names.


The company said its legal and privacy teams must sign off on all labeling efforts, adding that it recently introduced an auditing system ""to ensure that privacy expectations are being followed and parameters in place are working as expected.""


But one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users' posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union's year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.


""One of the key pieces of GDPR is purpose limitation,"" said John Kennedy, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who has worked on outsourcing, privacy and AI.


If the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.


It remains unclear exactly how GDPR will be interpreted and whether regulators and consumers would see Facebook's internal labeling practices as problematic. Europe's top data privacy official declined to comment on possible concerns.

Investors remained worried about the global economy, with 55 percent of those surveyed bearish on both the growth and inflation outlook for the next year.

“Cluster policing is happening around polling stations in the name of security and polling stations are being set up at a distance from a village and there are police personnel who are guarding it.

But TikTok — known as Douyin in China, where its parent company is based — must also be understood as one of the most popular of many short-video-sharing apps in that country. This is a landscape that evolved both alongside and at arm’s length from the U.S. tech industry — Instagram, for example, is banned in China.


Under the hood, TikTok is a fundamentally different app than American users have used before. It may look and feel like its friend-feed-centric peers, and you can follow and be followed; of course there are hugely popular “stars,"" many cultivated by the company itself. There’s messaging. Users can and do use it like any other social app. But the various aesthetic and functional similarities to Vine or Snapchat or Instagram belie a core difference: TikTok is more machine than man. In this way, it’s from the future — or at least a future. And it has some messages for us.


Twitter gained popularity as a tool for following people and being followed by other people and expanded from there. Twitter watched what its users did with its original concept and formalized the conversational behaviors they invented. Only then, and after going public, did it start to become more assertive. It made more recommendations. It started reordering users’ feeds based on what it thought they might want to see, or might have missed. Opaque machine intelligence encroached on the original system.


Something similar happened at Instagram, where algorithmic recommendation is now a very noticeable part of the experience, and on YouTube, where recommendations shuttle one around the platform in new and often ... let’s say surprising ways. Some users might feel affronted by these assertive new automatic features, which are clearly designed to increase interaction. One might reasonably worry that this trend serves the lowest demands of a brutal attention economy that is revealing tech companies as cynical time-mongers and turning us into mindless drones.


These changes have also tended to work, at least on those terms. We often do spend more time with the apps as they’ve become more assertive, and less intimately human, even as we’ve complained.


What’s both crucial and easy to miss about TikTok is how it has stepped over the midpoint between the familiar self-directed feed and an experience based first on algorithmic observation and inference. The most obvious clue is right there when you open the app: the first thing you see isn’t a feed of your friends, but a page called “For You."" It’s an algorithmic feed based on videos you’ve interacted with, or even just watched. It never runs out of material. It is not, unless you train it to be, full of people you know, or things you’ve explicitly told it you want to see. It’s full of things that you seem to have demonstrated you want to watch, no matter what you actually say you want to watch.


It is constantly learning from you and, over time, builds a presumably complex but opaque model of what you tend to watch, and shows you more of that, or things like that, or things related to that, or, honestly, who knows, but it seems to work. TikTok starts making assumptions the second you’ve opened the app, before you’ve really given it anything to work with. Imagine an Instagram centered entirely around its “Explore"" tab, or a Twitter built around, I guess, trending topics or viral tweets, with “following"" bolted onto the side.",1

Samsung is investigating how test versions of the $1,980 Galaxy Fold developed problems — including screen failures — after mere days of use


On Monday, Samsung executives convened at their headquarters and debated for hours before finally pulling the plug


When Samsung showed off its folding smartphone in San Francisco, engineers back in South Korea popped bottles of bubbly to celebrate the culmination of eight years of research. Two months and an aborted commercial release later, employees are scrambling to figure out what went wrong.


Samsung Electronics Co. on Tuesday scrapped what was to have been a crowning achievement, the launch of the world’s first mass-produced foldable smartphone.

The about-face allows Samsung to avoid another fiasco like the Note 7 in 2016, when smartphones that had already found their way into consumers’ hands showed a tendency to burst into flames.

"To be sure, the loss of jobs to machines is a global issue, but Indian women have a more limited range of alternative work than their male counterparts. And in family-focused India, women across economic lines often quit work after getting married or having children.


Still, when compared to nations with similar income levels, India's female labour participation rate is ""a distinct outlier,"" according to Vaishnav.


Economists say Modi's two signature economic policies - a ban on high-value banknotes in 2016 and the implementation of a national sales tax rate (GST) in 2017 - have hurt women more than men because they are more likely to be employed in vulnerable, informal workplaces.


Demonetisation thrust the informal, cash-based economy into turmoil. A year later, many small businesses went under, unable to deal with GST's complexities or rate increases.


""If there are fewer jobs available, who will move out? The women will move out, because they get lower wages. The men will go compete for the few jobs,"" said CMIE's CEO Mahesh Vyas.

""I have stopped all extra spending on clothes and good food,"" said Begum. ""If you ask anyone in Dharavi, everyone has seen a fall in income, lost their jobs or seen factories close after GST.""


Her dismay was echoed on the other side of the country, in a village near Kolkata, where Nuren Nesa's earnings from embroidering saris fell from 700 rupees a week to 300 after demonetisation. Following GST, work ground to a halt and her embroidery machine is gathering dust.",0

So, if you point the camera on your laptop’s keyboard, you will see it go into the “Super Macro"" mode, which helps in close-up shots.

"It's important to know how hackers can crack your password. According to McAfee Labs blog, users should avoid consecutive keyboard combinations or dictionary words, as they are easy targets for 'Dictionary attacks'. Hackers use software like John the Ripper that can automatically plug common words into password fields, making password cracking easy.


Using birthdays or names of family member, spouse or children is also not advised, since they can be easily inferred by scanning users’ social media posts. This form of attack is also known as Spidering.


Of course, reusing the same password for all accounts is another common mistake because hackers can get access to all your accounts by cracking one password.


Another common attack used by hackers is Brute Force. Unlike Dictionary attacks, here they don’t work on a list of commonly used passwords. Instead, more sophisticated tools are used to calculate every combination of letters and numbers. Longer passwords make the task difficult for hackers as they have to work with more combinations.",1

"The iPhone still generates the majority of Apple’s revenue, although sales of the devices fell last year as people upgraded less often. That triggered a stock slump that wiped more than $300 billion off the company’s market value since October. New models with more-capable cameras could spur upgrades and reignite Apple’s growth, making these upcoming iPhones the most critical in years.


A third camera on the back of the 2019 iPhone will help the device capture a larger field of view and enable a wider range of zoom. It will also capture more pixels so Apple software could, for example, automatically repair a video or photo to fit in a subject that may have been accidentally cut off from the initial shot, according to the people familiar with the plans. The company is also planning an enhanced version of its Live Photos feature, which pins video from before and after each shot to the photo. The new version will double the length of the video from three seconds to six seconds.


The laser-powered 3-D camera could debut first on an upgrade to the iPad Pro currently planned for as early as spring 2020, according to one of the people. Apple isn’t expected to release a major iPad Pro update this year like it did in 2018. It typically upgrades the line in the second half of the year. Apple in the past has launched major new features on the iPad before the iPhone, including 4G internet connectivity in 2012.


Apple is also testing some versions of this year’s iPhone line that includes a USB-C connector instead of the Lightning port that has been used on iPhones since 2012, indicating that the company plans an eventual switch, according to one of the people. Moving to USB-C would make the new models compatible with chargers used for hundreds of other devices, like Android phones.


This year’s iPhone models will include an upgraded Apple processor and use an updated Face ID sensor for unlocking the device and approving payments, the people said.

"A recent Amazon job posting, seeking a quality assurance manager for Alexa Data Services in Bucharest, describes the role humans play: “Every day she [Alexa] listens to thousands of people talking to her about different topics and different languages, and she needs our help to make sense of it all."" The want ad continues: “This is big data handling like you’ve never seen it. We’re creating, labeling, curating and analyzing vast quantities of speech on a daily basis.""


Amazon’s review process for speech data begins when Alexa pulls a random, small sampling of customer voice recordings and sends the audio files to the far-flung employees and contractors, according to a person familiar with the program’s design.


Some Alexa reviewers are tasked with transcribing users’ commands, comparing the recordings to Alexa's automated transcript, say, or annotating the interaction between user and machine. What did the person ask? Did Alexa provide an effective response?


Others note everything the speaker picks up, including background conversations—even when children are speaking. Sometimes listeners hear users discussing private details such as names or bank details; in such cases, they’re supposed to tick a dialog box denoting “critical data."" They then move on to the next audio file.


According to Amazon’s website, no audio is stored unless Echo detects the wake word or is activated by pressing a button. But sometimes Alexa appears to begin recording without any prompt at all, and the audio files start with a blaring television or unintelligible noise. Whether or not the activation is mistaken, the reviewers are required to transcribe it. One of the people said the auditors each transcribe as many as 100 recordings a day when Alexa receives no wake command or is triggered by accident. 


In homes around the world, Echo owners frequently speculate about who might be listening, according to two of the reviewers. “Do you work for the NSA?"" they ask. “Alexa, is someone else listening to us?"" ",1

"Parents can set up regular transfers of cash as a weekly allowance, or respond to requests for one-time cash approvals on short notice — if, say, a child is out with friends and needs more money. And children can also save money in FDIC-insured accounts, held at the traditional banks that issue the debit cards on behalf of the startups.


The cards charge monthly or annual fees. But they generally do not charge extra fees for loading the card with cash, as some other prepaid debit cards do.


The cards are reviving debates about whether it’s best to teach children about money using actual cash and coins, and whether children’s allowances should be tied to completion of household chores. The cards also raise concerns about the potential of plastic to encourage overspending.


“Parting with actual physical cash is harder,"" said Philip Fernbach, assistant professor of marketing at the Center for Research on Consumer Financial Decision Making at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado in Boulder.


Still, he said, the new digital tools offer ways to help children learn important financial concepts, like compound interest. Greenlight, for instance, allows parents to pay children a custom “parent"" rate — say, matching each dollar saved with another dollar or two — to encourage saving, at a time when rates on traditional savings accounts are quite low.

"Explaining how the Asus Zenfone Max M1 (ZB556KL) looks is very simple—make the Zenfone Max M1 Pro a bit smaller and boot that second rear camera.


You can buy the Asus Zenfone Max M1 off Flipkart at ₹7,499. The smartphone comes with Snapdragon 430 SoC, 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, 4,000mAh battery and a 5.45-inch HD+ display


mint-india-wire Asus Zenfone Max M1Asus Zenfone Max M1 reviewAsus Zenfone Max M1 FlipkartAsusAsus Zenfone Max M1 featuresAsus Zenfone Max M1 Pro


Asus has been on a roll this year, manufacturing three of the year’s most reasonable, understated smartphones. In fact, the Taiwanese smartphone maker revealed that the Zenfone Max Pro M1 sold more than a million units in less than six months.


Sadly, the company is also known for having one of the most difficult and unintuitive nomenclature systems among handset makers. Search Zenfone Max M1 and you’re presented only with search suggestions of the Zenfone Max M1 Pro. So, to avoid confusion, I’ll be calling the phone by its model number, ZB556KL, throughout the course of this review.


Explaining how the ZB556KL looks is very simple—make the Zenfone Max M1 Pro a bit smaller and boot that second rear camera. I dig the small form factor—very pocketable. It’s also pretty light, weighing in at only 150g. It skips the notch and still maintains a screen-to-body ratio of most conventional smartphones—proving that you can enjoy content without an ugly cutout.

Cargo movement on the waterway may also have an effect on aquatic life,"" head of a transport logistics company in Kolkata said, on the condition of anonymity.


While the focus of the central government is on the movement of cargo, the state government is using the river for transport of passengers. The TMC-led state government has started low-cost ferry services for passengers.

"What will be interesting to note is whether OnePlus finally brings waterproofing and wireless charging to its phone(s) this time. The company has skimped out on these features, arguing that waterproofing is too expensive and wireless charging is too slow, for the company to offer the same right now.


However, if you can spend three times on a display, a slight addition in cost for waterproofing really doesn’t seem like a big hitch. It’s worth noting though that Pete Lau had indicated to CNET earlier that wireless charging is not in the company’s list of things to do. That’s surprising given that Google has already been able to do faster charging using its Pixel Stand. Wireless charging may not be as fast as Warp Charge, but it’s certainly a feature flagships are expected to have now.


For a company that boasts the “best"" flagships out there, a price tag anywhere over Rs. 40,000 should ideally mean no spec if left unchecked.

"There’s also a tiny protrusion present centrally on the bottom of the rear. It is a part of the main frame, so to accommodate it Xiaomi has made a hole in the rear covering. My guess is Xiaomi put this to balance the phone better on a flat surface, similar to a Google Pixel. It has another function I discovered during my time of use — cleaning your pockets, as it is a lint magnet.


Coming to the front of the phone, the POCO F1 features a 6.2-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 2246x1080 and a pixel density of 403ppi. The screen is alright, it is adequately bright outdoors, reproduces colour pretty well and has decent viewing angles. But as is the case with most LCD displays, they lack the vibrance and contrast that AMOLED screens offer.


We didn’t face any issues with the screen while playing games, watching movies and even regular browsing.


It does possess a notch bigger than most other phones, but that’s because of the flood illuminator and the infrared camera it houses, apart from the selfie camera and the earpiece. The chin is also considerably bigger, but that trade-off works for it as well because it makes the phone easier to hold and you’ll grow used to it in no time.


Coming to the internals, the phone is rocking a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC coupled with an Adreno 630 GPU. Storage and memory options are spread across three variants: 6GB RAM with 64GB internal storage, 6GB RAM with 128GB internal storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. This phone comes with Xiaomi’s thermal solution called LiquidCooling, which helps keep the CPU temperatures low. This is not a marketing gimmick – it does help the power hungry Snapdragon 845 stay cool and provide its peak performance. Even after about an hour of gaming and watching videos, the CPU temperature remained around 40 degrees, which is not bad at all.


Using the phone for day-to-day tasks like browsing and scrolling through your feed is just like on any other flagship smartphone – fluid and effortless. The speakers are decent too, if not the loudest, so your video watching experience will also be good.",1

More jobs, accountability and women’s safety top concerns for young voters, show findings of the second round of the YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey


Young voters in urban India are most concerned about jobs, women’s safety, and corruption, according to the second round of the YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey conducted in January and February this year. Both Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters, as well as supporters of other parties, shared this view. Both sets of youth also want less conflicts and inequality in society even as they demand greater transparency and accountability from the government.


As the first part of this series showed, the BJP enjoyed much greater support than any other party among millennials and post-millennials at the time of the survey. However, a significant section of both BJP-leaning and non-BJP-leaning youth felt that unemployment, women’s safety, and corruption were among the biggest areas of concern currently.


If a sizeable section of the BJP-supporting youth are backing the ruling regime despite these concerns, it perhaps indicates that the opposition has been unable to offer a coherent response to these issues that would change the minds of these voters.",0

"The cables begin as a cluster of strands of tiny threads of glass fibres. Lasers propel data down the threads at nearly the speed of light, using fibre-optic technology. After reaching land and connecting with an existing network, the data needed to read an email or open a web page makes its way onto a person’s device.


While most of us now largely experience the internet through Wi-Fi and phone data plans, those systems eventually link up with physical cables that swiftly carry the information across continents or across oceans.


In the manufacturing process, the cables move through high-speed mills the size of jet engines, wrapping the wire in a copper casing that carries electricity across the line to keep the data moving. Depending on where the cable will be located, plastic, steel and tar are added later to help it withstand unpredictable ocean environments. When finished, the cables will end up the size of a thick garden hose.


A year of planning goes into charting a cable route that avoids underwater hazards, but the cables still have to withstand heavy currents, rock slides, earthquakes and interference from fishing trawlers. Each cable is expected to last up to 25 years.


A conveyor that staff members call “the Cable Highway"" moves the cable directly into Durable, docked in the Piscataqua River. The ship will carry more than 4,000 miles of cable weighing about 3,500 metric tons when fully loaded.


Inside the ship, workers spool the cable into cavernous tanks. One person walks the cable swiftly in a circle, as if laying out a massive garden hose, while others lie down to hold it in place to ensure it doesn’t snag or knot. Even with teams working around the clock, it takes about four weeks before the ship is loaded up with enough cable to hit the open sea.


The first trans-Atlantic cable was completed in 1858 to connect the United States and Britain. Queen Victoria commemorated the occasion with a message to President James Buchanan that took 16 hours to transmit.",1

Instead, its model is expected to more closely resemble the App Store, offering paid subscriptions to other media companies' programming and keeping a cut of sales.


Ahead of the launch, Apple negotiated deals that would let Apple bundle and sell networks at a discount, replicating a business model from the cable TV industry, one source familiar with the matter said.


Apple's goal, other sources have told Reuters, is to bring together television shows in one place to make it easier to find, buy and watch them. Apple has worked to make it easier to watch the shows on traditional television from manufacturers such as Sony Corp, VIZIO Inc, LG Electronics Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.


Apple's pitch to Hollywood is that it has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of viewers. The company said in January there were 1.4 billion active Apple devices, 900 million of which are iPhones. It has positioned that as leverage against Netflix's 139 million global customers and the 100 million subscribers to Amazon's Prime shipping program, which includes the video service.

Nationalism has become a convenient foil to legitimize all manner of parochial concerns.

"I think there are potentially three trends. We clearly see the wireless trend now, which gives you the convenience to cut the cord. As part of that, the new kind of interaction that customers are having is voice interaction, which started with smart speakers —the ability to speak out loud and not having to look at a screen is also increasing. I think in the “on the go"" world, where you maybe don’t want your phone in your hand all the time, notifications like directions, calendar, etc., are important.


I believe the wireless trend will move into a more smart and connected space. This is the second big trend you will see in the next 0-5 years. I think that probably a third, really far-reaching trend, which is fuzzier, is that at some point in the future, we won’t be using smartphones as we think of augmented reality, mixed reality or whatever you want to call it. This may be a 10-year trend, but as a company, we’re already working with early trendsetters like Magic Leap who have just launched their first such goggle. We’re providing audio accessories which also mix the audio reality, as part of our Ambeo setup. I think 5G will help in this space by potentially connecting us to the cloud, where you don’t necessarily have to go through the phone.",1

As the party prepares to seek a second term, it is increasingly accepting the fact that there was a need for coalition partners in different states and, thus, strengthening the NDA. One often spoke of the BJP and its NDA in the last five years. Given the alliances that the BJP is focusing on, the NDA partners are gaining increasing political visibility. The non-BJP parties, too, have realised the need to come together to challenge the BJP. A key element of the campaign is bound to be continued reference to ""strong"" (majboot) vs ""desperate"" (majboor) alliance.


Given the BJP’s increasing dependence on NDA partners, it would be difficult for them now to be critical of alliance politics. Beyond doubt, alliance arithmetic and political chemistry on the ground will be decisive in this election.",0

New Delhi: Collaboration and chat applications have tried to crack the Indian enterprises market for a while. But while apps, such as Slack and Facebook’s Workplace, are designed as workplace services, a large part of the country’s workforce doesn’t have emails to begin with. This makes WhatsApp a better collaboration tool for them.


Kaizala, Microsoft’s chat app for enterprises, aims at capitalising on these users. According to Anant Maheshwari, president, Microsoft India: “Kaizala was fundamentally designed for someone who may not have an email identity and, therefore, is leading with a mobile number as an identity. And, when you have a mobile number as your primary, if not the only identity, you have to do things very differently.""

"Within Facebook, some employees said they were confused as to why Zuckerberg found putting the messaging services together so compelling. Some said it was jarring because of his past promises about independence. When Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, Koum talked publicly about user privacy and said, “If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it.""


Early last month, during one of WhatsApp’s monthly Tuesday staff meetings, it became clear that Zuckerberg’s mandate would be a priority in 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter. One WhatsApp employee then ran an analysis on the number of potential new US users that the integration plan could bring to Facebook, said two people familiar with the study. The amount was relatively meager, the analysis showed.


To assuage concerns, Zuckerberg called a follow-up meeting with WhatsApp employees later in the week, three of the people said. On December 7, employees gathered around microphones at WhatsApp’s offices to ask Zuckerberg why he was so invested in merging the services. Some said his answers were vague and meandering. Several WhatsApp employees have left or plan to leave because of Zuckerberg’s plans, the people said.


Unifying the infrastructure for WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger is technically challenging. Unlike Facebook Messenger and Instagram, WhatsApp does not store user data or messages. It is the only one of the three services to currently use end-to-end encryption by default.


Encrypted messaging has long been supported by privacy advocates who fear governments or hackers may intrude into people’s personal messages. But it will raise other issues for Facebook, particularly around its ability to spot and curb the spread of illicit activity or disinformation.

Though election-induced volatility is real, it doesn’t hold much water in the long run as past election years have seen the currency appreciate in the run-up to the poll results, according to HDFC Bank research. “While elections-related uncertainty do affect Indian markets, it’s tough to draw a definite causality,"" the top private sector lender said in a note.


Ergo, the reasons are the good old trio of oil, growth and returns. Considering oil’s climb of nearly 26% so far this year, the trade balance for India is not looking pretty, especially as the trade deficit has grown 9% year-on-year for the first 10 months of FY19.

We may remember 2018 as the year when technology’s dystopian potential became clear, from Facebook’s role enabling the harvesting of our personal data for election interference to a seemingly unending series of revelations about the dark side of Silicon Valley’s connect-everything ethos.


The list is long: High-tech tools for immigration crackdowns. Fears of smartphone addiction . YouTube algorithms that steer youths into extremism. An experiment in gene-edited babies .


Doorbells and concert venues that can pinpoint individual faces and alert police. Repurposing genealogy websites to hunt for crime suspects based on a relative’s DNA. Automated systems that keep tabs of workers’ movements and habits. Electric cars in Shanghai transmitting their every movement to the government.


“It doesn’t so much feel like we’re living in the future now, as that we’re living in a retro-future,"" novelist William Gibson wrote this month on Twitter. “A dark, goofy ‘90s retro-future.""


More awaits us in 2019, as surveillance and data-collection efforts ramp up and artificial intelligence systems start sounding more human, reading facial expressions and generating fake video images so realistic that it will be harder to detect malicious distortions of the truth.


But there are also countermeasures afoot in Congress and state government — and even among tech-firm employees who are more active about ensuring their work is put to positive ends.


“Something that was heartening this year was that accompanying this parade of scandals was a growing public awareness that there’s an accountability crisis in tech,"" said Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of New York University’s AI Now Institute for studying the social implications of artificial intelligence.",1

Now, instead of 80% robots, it’s 80% human activity in assembling cars and we’ve since seen others like Tesla do the same.


I think companies experience stagnation on AI for a few reasons. One can be the data and lack of access to it—where they don’t have the data in the right way to support AI programs.


The third is the wrong mindset that looks at AI just as a cost or efficiency play, and not a growth or new business opportunity play.

"The Digital India initiative is a significant initiative that has helped India leapfrog in many aspects. It has transformed the way communities, citizens, states, and industries operate today. The penetration of mobile devices and services alone has created a new channel for the delivery of public services. For example, the UPI-based digital payments platform has democratized financial transactions on an unprecedented scale. Intelligent networks have become a foundation of Digital India, making most of the government’s initiatives such as Make in India, Smart Cities, financial inclusion, startup India more relevant than ever.


According to a new Cisco-IDC report, digital disruption is likely to add over 1.4 million new IT jobs by 2027 in India, primarily in areas like cybersecurity, automation, AI, networking and data analytics. AI will create new roles which never existed before like ‘empathy trainer’ for AI devices, or an AI ‘ethics auditor.’


India faces the highest number of cybersecurity threats in the Asia-Pacific region with over 500,000 alerts daily. Considering the growing threat landscape, companies and governments should consider adopting advanced security technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to investigate and identify alerts.


Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.


We believe data analytics and AI will have the maximum impact in India and globally. About 90% of global data was created in the last couple of years but only 1-3% of this data has been analyzed. Intel is inventing technologies and software tools that will advance the AI ecosystem, making it possible to gain insight, anticipate needs and continuously learn from data at enterprise scale.


Regulations such as GDPR offer an opportunity for India to leverage its vast technology expertise and talent pool to address the need for privacy compliant solutions globally.


In the last 18 months or so, India went from being 155th to being #1 globally in mobile data consumption, which underlines the scale of the opportunity in this market. That’s set the stage for data-led transformation of our country. India is on the cusp of 5G adoption with the auction of spectrum for 5G services likely to happen in the latter half of 2019.


India today presents a fascinating data driven transformation story. There is no other country that has digitized similar volumes of citizen data. Our future is going to be data driven and India provides a significant data science opportunity. Through our 20 years in the Indian market, we have been committed to working closely with the government, the developer community, and industry collaborators to accelerate new technology adoption and strengthen our local ecosystem to help enable a digitally empowered society.


Industry reports indicate that AI will actually create more jobs than it is expected to eliminate globally. India has an opportunity to tap into its existing pool of mathematicians, statisticians, and programmers and nurture this talent to leverage their skills for analytics and AI. Intel is committed to democratizing AI through deep industry, academic, and government collaborations. Last year, we committed to training 15,000 developers, students, and professors in AI. We have long surpassed our goal and have today engaged with more than 112,000 people across more than 130 corporate organizations and academia.


Today there is a need to understand that when it comes to securing data, software alone is no longer enough. Hardware-enabled security capabilities improve an organization’s security posture and mitigate risk, offering safer data exchanges and secure storage and processing.


While India Inc is spending more on cybersecurity each year, there is still a lot of work to be done to increase awareness of risks and drive home the need for continuous focus and investment in end to end security.


Thoughts on AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), Blockchain, IoT, AR-VR, 3D Printing, Automation and Robotics.


New age technologies like AI, AR-VR, and 3D Printing are today changing the way people experience the world, and can potentially disrupt the industry with new ways by which brands can delight their end-customers.


At Adobe, we are focused on leveraging the power of technologies like AI to enhance the way our customers are experiencing and benefiting from our products. With the Adobe Sensei framework, we apply AI and machine learning to solve customer problems across the various aspects of creativity (Creative Cloud), digital documents (Document Cloud), and digital experiences (Experience Cloud), where Adobe has domain expertise. Adobe Sensei is fuelled by the tens of millions of content assets to the trillions of transactions we process for customers.


We firmly believe technologies like AI will enhance human creativity, and not replace it. AI is already being used in our products to improve the creative process, drive efficiencies, make recommendations, and enhancing accessibility as well as ease of use.


India has leap-frogged ahead of many countries on its digital transformation journey, and this remarkable growth story has been driven by factors like its rapid adoption of data services, proliferation of mobile devices, strong millennial population, and Prime Minister Modi’s digital initiatives that are playing an instrumental role in building the country into a true digital-first economy. Adobe remains committed to delivering the latest innovation for Indians and is a big supporter of the government’s Digital India agenda—our deal with the Ministry of Skill Development to give a million students access to Adobe Spark (tool for easily creating high-quality graphics, web pages, and video stories) is a case in point.

"Voltas has seen immense benefits by using IoT to gather data to perform preventive and predictive maintenance of its cooling equipment. Providing services to a fragmented enterprise customer base of 3,500 across 45 locations in the country was proving to be a major challenge for the company. That is when it decided to turn away from a reactive after-sales service, where it had to be informed by the customer of the breakdown, to an I-T-based predictive and preventive maintenance system where all connected Voltas equipment share real-time data with their engineers, allowing them to remotely keep track of the equipment’s health. This not only helped them prevent failures but also ensured customers’ business remained unaffected by breakdowns. According to Voltas, the general turnaround time is 10-12 days, but with the help of IoT, it has managed to bring it down to three days. In terms of cost savings, this has allowed the company to reduce raw material and overhead rationalization by 10% and has led to revenue growth of 15% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) since deployment.


HDFC Bank processes around five million loan applications across multiple locations every year. The average processing time for each loan request was over 45 minutes as everything from application indexing, data entry, document verification and underwriting forward was being done manually.

Loan processing across all locations is now placed in a centralized server where real-time loan processing status would be visible to all credit administrators. It has also allowed the bank to allocate the cases to credit managers based on the nature of loan, location and eligibility.


This has reduced the turnaround time for processing loan requests by 50%, offering the bank the opportunity to scale up and handle more customers. The tangible benefits of RPA have been the improvement in productivity of data entry staff by 40% and decision-making staff by up to 12%.

Though rural battles are being fought over the deepening agrarian distress, farm loan waivers and populist programmes, issues in urban centres like Bengaluru is likely to include topics like unemployment, corruption and even the controversial Rafale fighter aircraft deal that appears to have resonated with a section of the large middle class population.

Gandhi’s move came in response to a contempt petition filed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi on a statement he had made while filing his nomination in Amethi on 10 April. At the time, Gandhi had said that the apex court’s decision to admit certain documents in the case on the Rafale fighter jet deal, in which the Congress alleges government corruption, meant that “Supreme Court ne kaha hai ki chowkidar hi chor hai"" (Supreme Court has said that the watchman is the thief).


Gandhi clarified on Monday that on 10 April when he reached the district collector’s room in Amethi he was “accosted"" by local journalists who wanted his reaction on the Rafale judgement. Gandhi said he had not read the order and gave a reaction based on what he had read on the electronic and social media.

"Smart battery: One of the most common problems users have with smartphones is that their batteries deteriorate over time. However, Google says that its net promoter score (NPS) for the Pixel’s battery life indicates that it’s increasing.

Similarly, Google introduced a smart compose—when you’re writing an email using Gmail on the Pixel 3, the app will automatically start finishing your sentences. When you write ‘my address is’, the phone taps into Google Maps to find your home address.


To be sure, all these AI elements often require new hardware. This is the reason why Google put its own Visual Core chipset inside the Pixel phones.

"Modi’s strong response to the Pulwama and Uri terrorist attacks may have high recall value for the Indian public when they elect the next government


Modi had spoken tough on terrorism emanating from Pakistan well before he assumed office on 26 May 2014, and subsequently too


NEW DELHI: Akey engagement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25 February was dedicating the National War Memorial to the nation. Modi was at his fiery best, slamming the opposition for compromising national security through delayed acquisitions of military hardware and corrupt procurement procedures. There was nothing in his demeanour to suggest that India would in the space of less than 12 hours, in the early hours of 26 February, be using its Air Force to conduct an air strike inside Pakistani territory, something that last happened in the 1971 war with Pakistan. To his immediate and wider audience, Modi’s speech seemed typical of him, turning tables on his detractors who have accused him of helping big business win spin-off projects from defence deals.


A person familiar with the events of 25 February said Modi returned to his official residence past 9pm. “We were later told that the prime minister did not go to sleep as he usually does by midnight but was awake well past that time,"" said the person mentioned above. “It was a little before 3am on Tuesday (26 February) that the prime minister was informed that our fighter aircraft had taken off for their mission,"" the person said.


It was past 4am on 26 February morning when Mirage 2000 jets of the Indian Air Force returned to their base after bombing a terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The person quoted above said Modi spoke to one of the pilots who took part in the strike, as well as the Air Force officer in charge of the Gwalior base from where the fighter jets had taken off.


It was decided that foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale would make an official announcement to convey to the country and to the international audience that India’s air strike was a “pre-emptive"" counter-terrorism operation in the face of “imminent"" danger of another possible terror attack and not a military one and that it came against the backdrop of a suicide attack on 14 February in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama region in which 40 paramilitary soldiers were killed.",0

The consumer version of Google+, for instance, “currently has low usage and engagement—90% of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds,"" Ben Smith, Google vice president of engineering, said in an official blog post in October.

"Not being able to use a phone as the basis of a desktop PC, or having a stylus on hand at any time for handwriting and annotation, hasn’t stopped Apple from selling hundreds of millions of phones. Instead, with the iPhone Xs Max, the US company continued to focus on relative simplicity and a tightly integrated ecosystem of hardware, operating system and apps, which has historically been seen to give its siblings an edge in terms of performance consistency. This ease of use comes in lieu of the manufacturer padding out a specification sheet with technologies nobody asked for and few people use.


With a starting price of 1,049 euros ($1,216) in Europe, Huawei has presented a phone at the top end of the current flagship market pricing spectrum. On the continent it’s cheaper than the rival iPhone, but more costly than the Note 9. It’s packed with every cutting-edge technology the Chinese company could throw at it, and on paper at least will appeal to hardcore gadget lovers for good reason. But familiarity (and marketing savvy) will no doubt work in Samsung and Apple’s favour, as both companies know better than to deviate from their tried-and-tested formulas.


While Apple can expect Huawei’s new model poses little threat to its most important product—particularly in the US—that may not be as true for Samsung. The Galaxy Note 9 and Mate 20 Pro are both expensive Android devices to upgrade to, but with so many of the Note’s key features available in the Mate 20 Pro — along with a number of Apple’s — Huawei’s latest effort could be a head-turner.

"Indian politicians understand that sense of humour, sarcasm or name-calling has a wider reach, and more likes online mean more votes. The BJP’s Rahul is ‘pappu’ campaign is the biggest example. (Jayachandran/Mint)


From Rahul Gandhi being a ‘pappu’ to his ‘chowkidar chor hai’ campaign against Narendra Modi, Twitter is the battleground of wit


From being the subject of insults, ‘pappu’ has transformed himself into the master of insults on Twitter


On the evening of 11 April, as the first phase of India’s marathon elections wound to a close, Samajwadi Party chief and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav took to Twitter to reflect on the significance of humanity’s first-ever snapshot of a black hole, which had been released to the public only a few hours ago. “Ab to black hole bhi dikh gaya. Bas achche din hi hain jo nazar nahi aatey (We have even seen a black hole now, but ‘acche din’ are still out of sight),"" he wrote. Within minutes, that short, pithy one-liner was retweeted hundreds of times.


Whether Yadav understands the actual significance of the black hole image or not, he does have a firm grip on one aspect of Indian politics: insults work. They have power. They can be useful. And they can inform a great deal about particular moments in politics.


This poll season, the Election Commission has been sent scrambling several times due to the use of insults—targeted at individuals, communities, and even geographic regions (Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah said it was difficult to make out whether Rahul Gandhi’s Wayanad rally happened in India or Pakistan). Why do politicians rely so often on insult though? It is of course a guaranteed applause line at an election rally, garners instant media attention, and if one is lucky, perhaps some votes. But it is hard to quantify these effects—until now.


Most politicians these days are active on Twitter and often choose to bypass traditional media and speak directly via online channels. Every tweet can be tagged, analyzed and tracked on metrics of virality. And a sample of every tweet since 1 January 2017 (over 19,000 of them hand-coded for insults or confrontational language) by five top politicians—Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi, and Mamata Banerjee—throws up some interesting findings.",0

Logitech has tried to meet Amazon and Google halfway. Rather than tell smart speakers what each device connected to Logitech's Harmony remote controls were doing, Crowe says Logitech reports back with broad descriptions, specifying that a user is watching television instead of passing on information about their choice of channel, for instance.


Crowe says Logitech has had conversations about status reporting with Amazon and Google, but declined to detail them. Executives at two other smart device makers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect business relationships, say they’ve asked for concessions from Amazon and Google related to user privacy or transparency and guarantees about use of the data, but been rebuffed.


An Amazon spokesman says the company doesn’t sell user data and doesn’t use information it gets from status reports for advertising. Status reports, he says, are designed to enable useful features for customers. He declined to comment on how long Amazon stores the data. A Google spokesman declined to comment on the company’s implementation of status updates.


Russell, the analyst with Parks Associates, calls status reporting “a bit of a Trojan Horse request."" Amazon and Google, he says, are suggesting “‘Hey, help us help you by giving us the status of your device, and make everyone’s life easier.’ But what they’re not saying is, ‘Gee, we can do a lot with that data.""

"Director John Singleton, who made one of Hollywood’s most memorable debuts with the Oscar-nominated Boyz N the Hood and continued over the following decades to probe the lives of black communities in his native Los Angeles and beyond, has died


Singleton’s family said on Monday that he died in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, after being taken off life support


Singleton was in his early 20s, just out of the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, when he wrote, directed and produced Boyz N the Hood


 Based on Singleton’s upbringing and shot in his old neighborhood, the low-budget production starred Cuba Gooding Jr


 and Ice Cube and centered on three friends in South Central Los Angeles, where college aspirations competed with the pressures of gang life


 Boyz N the Hood was a critical and commercial hit, given a 20-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and praised as a groundbreaking extension of rap to the big screen, a realistic and compassionate take on race, class, peer pressure and family


”For many, the 1991 release captured the explosive mood in Los Angeles in the months following the videotaped police beating of Rodney King


 Boyz N the Hood also came out at a time when, thanks to the efforts to Spike Lee and others, black films were starting to get made by Hollywood after a long absence

"Intelligence units are on high alert over the rising instances of encounters between militants and security forces following the suicide attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Pulwama on 14 February that killed 40 personnel of the force. However, this has not deterred the Congress-NC alliance, the PDP and the BJP from firming up their campaign plans to win as many of the six Lok Sabha seats from the state, albeit with an eye on the assembly elections.


The Congress-NC alliance is working hard to increase its tally in the Kashmir valley. NC president and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah had lost to PDP’s Tariq Hameed Karra in Srinagar in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but had subsequently won the 2017 bypoll to the constituency defeating Nazir Ahmed Khan of the PDP.


The PDP , which has only one member of Parliament (MP) in Muzaffar Hussain Baig who represents the Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency, may find little support on the ground. Its government fell in June 2018, following the BJP’s decision to walk out of the alliance between the two parties in the state. Former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti has, however, decided to contest from Anantnag, which has been vacant since she resigned in April 2016. The party is also readying to field a strong candidate to take on Abdullah in the pivotal Srinagar seat. The party has, however, agreed to stay away from the Udhampur constituency so that secular votes are not divided.


The BJP, which had won the Ladakh, Udhampur and Jammu constituencies in the Jammu region in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with a vote share of 23%, aims to make inroads into the valley.

"Now imagine that at one point in each pass around your head, you let the string out a little, and then pull it back in later. When you let the string out, the stone moves further away and slows down; when you pull it back in, it moves back towards you and speeds up. You need to be careful not to let out too much string or again, the stone will slow so much that it drops down. If you don’t want this to happen, you’ll have to speed up your whirling each time you let string out.


This is a passable model of what will happen with Beresheet. Gravity keeps it in orbit, as it does every other object that whirls around the earth, acting like the string you’ve tied to your stone. But that’s where the parallel to satellites and the ISS ends. With each orbit, Beresheet will fire its engine, which sends it sailing just a bit further from our planet than on its previous orbit. Then it swings back towards the earth, picking up speed as it approaches and circles us. Fire the engine again and… well, as you can imagine, this process results in ever-larger orbits.


In effect, Beresheet uses the earth’s gravity as a slingshot, building up speed and increasing its distance from the earth with each orbit. Our own Mangalyaan did much the same a few years ago, as I explained in my column “Mars, here we are"". Eventually, Mangalyaan’s orbits got so elongated that it could effectively escape earth’s gravity and set a course for Mars. Over the next three weeks, Beresheet’s orbit will elongate similarly, until it spans close to 400,000km.


When that happens, the orbit will have ranged past the moon. That is, the expansion of Beresheet’s orbits has been calculated precisely so that it will intercept the moon at a particular convenient time about three weeks from now. The precision is necessary because the moon has an elliptical orbit which takes it from a low of about 350,000km to a high of about 410,000km from us. So it makes sense to plan this encounter with the moon for the point in its orbit when it is closest to us. As you read this on 1 March, the moon is about 400,000km away; on 20 March, it will have swung substantially closer, to just 359,000km away.


Aside: If you remember, there was mention of a “supermoon"" on 19 February — because on that day, the moon was under 357,000km away, its closest approach till 2024. Beresheet did not launch in time to take advantage of that proximity, which is why it is shooting for 20 March.


What will begin on 20 March is, as Beresheet’s Israeli team describes it, the process of “lunar capture"". I like the bravado of that term, the very vision of a tiny spacecraft “capturing"" a gigantic rock out there in space. Of course it’s more accurately described as a “Beresheet capture"", because it is Beresheet that will eventually start orbiting the moon. Then again, we would say that only because Beresheet is much smaller than the moon. In truth, when we think of one object orbiting a second, we might equally well describe the phenomenon as the second object orbiting the first, whatever their sizes are. So “lunar capture"" fits after all.",1

That said, weak motorcycle and moped sales mirror the stress in rural areas. And the weakness trickled all the way down to net profit, too, which fell 19.2% y-o-y to ₹133.8 crore. On top of this, it is unlikely that TVS’s profit growth will see any smart turnaround.

"Still, the nascent smart-home market is fiercely contested, and some critics acknowledge their worries about data collection are partly motivated by concerns that Amazon and Google will use their central position to muscle out rivals and dictate terms to the rest of the market. Moreover, some other smart-home companies themselves gather status reports, though they lack the scale or billion-dollar advertising businesses of the tech giants.


Meanwhile, plenty of companies say they are on-board with status reporting. Matt McPherson, an engineering manager with Hunter Fan Co., says that before the advent of status reports, device sometimes shut down without answering the user's command. “Do I think these guys are intentionally grabbing data in order to find some way of advertising?"" he asks. “At this moment I don’t think so, but I can see something of that nature happening in the future.""


Some say Amazon and Google would do well to be more transparent by telling users, outside of the confines of lengthy privacy policies, what data they’re collecting and offering more fine-grained options for managing it. Amazon and Google let users delete accumulated smart-home data, but neither offers an option to stop collecting it from specific devices in the first place.

It’s less likely they know that linking a television to the system begins a process of transmitting updates when someone changes the channel or turns it on or off.

"Rise of the Digital Consumer: We have 90 million online shoppers in India today—eight times more than in 2013. Our research identified a highly-evolving consumer engaged in a broader set of online activities—eight categories of behaviour that include, consuming media, pursuing studies, managing finances, and of course shopping.


■ Omni-channel grows, but offline still dominant: We see three clear pathways—mostly offline, substantially mixed and largely online and whilst digital penetration increases offline will stay dominant. Our analysis indicates that 78% of purchases are done offline, accounting for 58% of value, against 16% purchases that followed a pure online pathway from beginning to end; balance 5% has mixed pathways. B2C retailers will increasingly focus on nuanced understanding of customer journeys, strengthen specific channels that are designed to deliver different needs in different situations. E.g. 43% of India’s new-car buyers select the model through online search, and close the transaction at the dealership. This is forcing automotive players to look beyond channels to holistically re-examine the roles of their dealership channels.


■ Impulse counts, in the new convenience economy: Anytime-anywhere connectivity coupled with surge in e-commerce and online payments, will drive significant impulsive shopping growth, making it a lever to consider. Fashion will be the top gainer along with segments such as packaged food, fast moving consumer goods, etc. driven by special offers will drive nearly 30% to 40% of overall purchases.",1

"Congress president Rahul Gandhi on 25 March announced Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY), which will cover around 50 million families or 250 million individuals if implemented. (PTI)


If and when Congress' Nyuntam Aay Yojana, or NYAY scheme, for minimum income guarantee is implemented, it'll be the biggest basic income globally. Here's a snap analysis


On 25 March, Congress president Rahul Gandhi announced the Nyuntam Aay Yojana, or NYAY scheme. The plan is to give ₹6,000 every month to the bottom 20% of the population of around 5 crore families or 25 crore individuals. Gandhi’s proposal is not that of universal basic income (UBI), of which there has been a lot of talk in the recent past. UBI is basically a small amount of money paid every month to every citizen of a country, without any terms and conditions. In the case of NYAY, the plan is to pay money to the bottom 20% only and not every citizen as UBI envisages.


If and when it is launched, NYAY will be by far the biggest basic income scheme anywhere in the world. Given that there are valid concerns on the viability of the scheme and the impact it is likely to have on the Indian economy, we try and address some of the concerns in detail.


This concern comes from the fact that the government will be distributing free money under the NYAY scheme with no conditions attached. If one looks at the PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi scheme, it is already doing the same though to families which own agricultural land of less than two hectares. Of course, the amount in case of PM-KISAN is much lower at Rs2,000 per quarter against the ₹6,000 per month promised under NYAY. But ultimately free money is free money, irrespective of whether it is being given by the current government or proposed by an opposition party.


Also, anyone who looks at basic income as something for nothing, should have issues with other forms of the same phenomenon. Guy Standing, an economist at the School Of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, writes about this in Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen, “Anyone opposing basic income on this ground (free money) should also oppose all wealth inheritance and all other forms of income that are not derived from productive activity… They should oppose all the selective tax breaks… which mostly benefit the affluent who have done nothing to ‘earn’ them.""


This concern stems from the fact that incomes of a large section of population will go up suddenly. This higher income will chase the same set of goods and services available in the market and will ultimately lead to higher prices. In theory, this makes immense sense. When people suggest that basic income schemes will lead to inflation, they tend to believe that the supply of goods and services will continue to remain the same, despite an increase in income. The trouble is that there is a lot of evidence to the contrary.",0

"True, there was some good news in that the average discount of ₹15,125 per vehicle offered in the March quarter is much lower than the all-time high discount of ₹24,300 offered in the December quarter.

Yet, Maruti Suzuki faces adversities, along with its peers. The most glaring concern is the impact of spiralling fuel prices, which can further affect buyer sentiment. Besides, auto companies face higher costs on account of safety regulation compliance and the new technology demands under BS-VI emission standards.


Further, operating margins will be under pressure due to subdued volumes, higher commodity prices and adverse forex costs. On top of it all, the company has to contend with continued product discounts.

If it successfully lands on the moon, Beresheet will be the first privately funded spacecraft—and Israel is the fourth country—to achieve that feat 


With less of a fuss than I might have expected, a remarkable competition ended last year. The interesting thing about it? There was no winner. In fact, the competition ended precisely because there was no longer a chance that there could be a winner.


Perhaps you know that I’m referring to the Google Lunar X Prize competition. It was intended as a catalyst for private space exploration, as opposed to efforts by national agencies like Isro or Nasa. Specifically, the challenge was to land a rover on the moon, have it travel 500m and send home images and video. The first privately funded team that could do this by 31 March 2018—a deadline that had been extended twice—would win the prize, $30 million.


Several teams from around the world entered the competition. In early 2017, five finalists were announced: among them, Team Indus from Bengaluru. But in January 2018, the competition was shut down because none of these five would be able to meet the 31 March launch deadline.


Competition or not, some of the teams decided to keep their efforts going. Two of those are Team Indus and SpaceIL from Israel—and on 21 February, SpaceIL’s moon lander shot into space atop a Space X Falcon 9 rocket. So if all goes well, SpaceIL’s craft, Beresheet (Hebrew for “genesis"" or “in the beginning""), will soon land on the moon.",1

Berlin: Some two years after stepping into the spotlight, voice assistants are learning new languages and connecting to ever-more devices around the home -- but mass adoption and widespread ease with the new technology remain some way off.

However, the pattern was uneven. Not too far away from Wayanad is Ponnani seat, where Muslim League's heavyweight politician ET Muhammed Basheer was expected to be also benefitted by the Rahul wave. But the turnout was only 74.96%.


The Sabarimala issue may be key to understand why some South Kerala constituencies polled higher than usual. More than 10 lakh people voted for the first time in history at Pathanamthitta (74.19% turnout), the ground zero of Sabarimala protests, clearly a reflection of the high profile tri-corner contest between the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPM, candidate Veena George, Congress’ Anto Antony and BJP's K Surendran.


The Sabarimala factor, related to pro-and-against forces rallying behind a faithful ban for menstrual age women in the temple, may have also influenced a large number of women voters to come out and vote.


Both Left and Right wing leaders Mint spoke to claimed that the women voters, who visibly populated in unusually large numbers in the voting queues in southern districts where Sabarimala is influential, voted for them.

"Gunadeep Dutta, a second-year undergraduate student in Guwahati, who will be voting for the first time, says that successive governments in Assam have done a reasonably good job of ushering development in the state but feels there is room for more to be done.


“The state and its people have a lot of potential which is not being leveraged,"" he says. “The government should incentivize locals who set up industries or businesses in the region and create employment,"" says Dutta.


The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government is expected to move again on the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which proposes to grant citizenship to Hindu immigrants who face persecution in other countries. As such, there are concerns about the effects the implementation of the bill will have.

"In an online opinion poll conducted by Northeast Now, voters have ranked the issue of illegal migration in the North-East as their top concern followed by development. (Deborshi Chaki/Mint)


Assam is open to outsiders, unlike the rest of North-East where migrants from other parts of the country need an ILP to buy land


GUWAHATI: Growing up in Guwahati, politics was of little interest to 22-year-old Mehzabin Sultana. However, as Assam goes to polls on 11 April, she says job creation is the most crucial among all the electoral promises made so far.


Torn between ethnic strife and years of armed insurgency by several violent extremist groups, including the United Liberation front of Assam ( ULFA), a large section of youngsters have over the years moved out of the state to build a career. However, as the frequency of violence on the streets of Assam recedes, many are now reconsidering career options and seeking opportunities at home.",0

"Let’s take the example of the basic income pilot study carried out in Madhya Pradesh between 2009-13. As Standing points out: “Villagers’ increased purchasing power led to local farmers to plant more rice and wheat, use more fertilizer and cultivate more of their land. Their earnings went up, while the unit price of food went down."" In fact, a similar thing happened with clothes. As people earned more, the demand for better clothes went up. Women in the villages saw this as an entrepreneurial opportunity. They bought sewing machines and material to sew new clothes. A new market was created where none existed. As Standing puts it: “A similar response could be expected in any community where there are people who want to earn more and do more.""


Evidence from many such studies carried out in Africa seems to suggest the same. As a Unicef document titled From Evidence to Action: The Story of Cash Transfers and Impact Evaluation in Sub-Saharan Africa points out: “With the exception of temporary price increases occurring during payment periods, there is no evidence that the cash transfers have led to inflation.""


There are a couple of other things that need to be stated here. Demonetisation destroyed a large part of the informal economy in India, rendering many Indians jobless. Of course, there is also the case of India’s demographic dividend, or the fact that 10-12 million Indian youth are entering the workforce every year and for whom enough jobs are not being created.


Given this, as the Unicef document mentioned earlier points out: “In an economy with high levels of unemployment, a stimulus programme like cash transfers (which is what any basic income scheme basically is) may increase the local labour demand without exerting significant upward pressure on wages.""


Of course, one also needs to take into account the fact that NYAY, if ever implemented, will be the largest basic income scheme in the world. Hence, it will be important to implement it gradually across the length and breadth of India, to rein in any danger of inflation. While NYAY is not UBI in the strictest sense of the term, the Economic Survey 2016-17 essentially states that a guiding principle for UBI is gradualism. The Congress has talked about phased implementation.


In the Indian case, this concern comes from a patriarchal view of the society. As Arvind Subramanian writes in Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy, “If men control the wallet, as they often do, cash transfers would be imprudently used—and used more in line with the preferences of adult males than the real needs of the family—which would make women and children worse off.""


The point being that if you give men the money, they will spend it on alcohol and tobacco. But is that really the case? As the Economic Survey 2016-17 points out: “One can define consumption on alcohol, tobacco and paan as consumption on ‘temptation goods’. The main finding is that these goods form a smaller share of overall budget/consumption as overall consumption rises. This is an indication that an increase in income from UBI alone will not necessarily lead to an increase in temptation goods consumption.""",0

In fact, the AP chief minister even went to the extent of organizing a state-sponsered day-long protest in New Delhi in February, for which he took scores of people from Andhra Pradesh in two special trains. With 25 Lok Sabha seats in AP, Naidu might have some leverage if he manages to win a good number of seats this time.

Unsurprisingly, its manifesto devotes the first chapter to jobs.


In reality, economic hardships have exacerbated over the past three years and both parties make extra efforts to appear sympathetic. Both are relying on their individual versions of social welfare schemes and safety nets to appeal to the voter. One welfare scheme—cash transfers—has caught the fancy of both parties, adding custom-built bells and whistles. A basic guaranteed income has been promised, with clear targeting.

Some device makers are pushing back, saying automatic device updates don’t give users enough control over what data they share, or how it can be used. Public guidelines published by Amazon and Google don’t appear to set limits on what the companies can do with the information they glean about how people use appliances.


Amazon and Google say they collect the data to make it easier for people to manage their home electronics. Automatic status updates reduce the time it takes to process voice commands and lets smart-home hubs present up-to-date information on a screen or smartphone app. Greater awareness of what’s going on also lets them proactively suggest helpful uses for their voice assistants, and develop new ones.


Smart speakers are among the fastest growing categories of consumer electronics, led by Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home devices. That’s pushed the companies and their Alexa and Assistant software deeper into debates about the tradeoffs between useful services and the harvesting of personal data. Both have had public pratfalls around privacy of voice commands, either recording private messages in error or sending them to others.


The commercial success of voice assistants has bolstered dozens of companies working to build interest in internet-enabled televisions, kitchen appliances and other devices. Many people first start tinkering with connected appliances after buying a smart speaker. Surveys show about a quarter of U.S. smart speaker owners regularly use them to control something else, a percentage analysts expect to rise.


When smart speakers first hit the market, using them to command another device worked like this. After receiving the command “Alexa, turn on the light,"" the software would ask the light bulb maker’s servers for the current status of the bulb. After a reply came back confirming the switch was off, Alexa would instruct the light to turn on.


Now, in a push that accelerated last year, Amazon and Google are recommending—and, in some cases, requiring—that smart home makers tweak their code to reverse that relationship. Instead, the light bulb must report in to the hub with its status at all times.",1

"We are hopeful of winning up to 18-20 seats as an alliance but BJP alone should be able to get 15 seats across the North-East. Last time, we had won 7 seats from Assam and one seat in Arunachal Pradesh.


At least I think (so). I travelled across North-East and across Assam. Response of the crowd is much better than our response in assembly elections.


I think it came out of a tactical necessity. In a particular constituency, we have denied ticket to our sitting MP so there was a thinking in the party that we should do a padayatra taking both the new and old candidate on right and left side of me; so that was the initial thinking. But then the padayatra got such a tremendous response, we decided to expand it.


It is new because padayatras used to be done from atop a vehicle. In Silchar, the day after my padayatra, Priyanka Gandhi came and she was on top of a vehicle. Then people started comparing.

"What is a pixel? In theory, pixels on a camera sensor are photosensitive diodes that are selectively sensitive to red, green or blue frequencies, hence breaking down incident light to capture more colour data. Typically, pixels are arranged in grids, where image processors take data from and combine to create photographs that you see. The quality of photographs often depend on how large a pixel is, and how much data is captured by them, hence creating the best balance between brightness and colours.


How does Pixel Binning help? In Pixel Binning, multiple adjacent pixels are combined into one. Pixel Binning on current smartphones is done by combining smaller pixels into 2x2 grids, hence creating overall “effective pixel"" size that is larger than the standard pixels. Since four pixels are combined or “binned"" together, the effective resolution is reduced to a quarter of the total sensor resolution —48MP, in case of the Sony IMX586 and the Samsung ISOCELL GM1.",1

Buyers should examine the actual pictures and not purchase on megapixels or total lenses alone, but it’s obvious photography is an arena where Huawei is determined to show it’s innovating.


Because there are so many variables, measuring and comparing the raw horsepower and speed of a phone is difficult, and often pointless. But Apple, Huawei and Samsung’s flagships all contain some of the most cutting-edge silicon available to mobile products, with specifications and capacity that mirror—or exceed—those of many laptops. It’s fair to assume all three will run any app you load onto it.


Samsung appeals to hardcore productivity fans with its use of a stylus, and the ability, via a cable, for the Note 9 to be connected to a computer monitor to run desktop applications as would be expected on a laptop. It also runs on Google’s Android, which is more flexible than Apple’s iOS.


Huawei’s competitor is also based on Android and offers the PC-like functionality too, albeit wirelessly, but lacks a stylus. The Chinese company chose another path of differentiation: its wireless charging feature works in two directions, meaning a pair of compatible headphones or even another phone can be charged by placing them on top of the Mate 20 Pro.

"New Delhi: Keeping two separate phones for work and personal use can be a hassle as it requires employees to keep two devices on them all the time. But storing both work and personal information on one device can also put you and your company at risk, cautions Sukesh Jain, senior vice president, IT and mobile enterprise business at Samsung India.


Letting the company handle it: Many companies use mobile device management (MDM) services such as Samsung Knox for Enterprises, Google Apps Mobile Management, Citrix XenMobile, AirWatch by VMware and Microsoft Intune. Compatible with both Android and iOS devices. These tools segregate work apps into encrypted compartments, allowing IT administrators more control over passwords and the option to wipe all the data if the employee loses the device or leaves the company. However, many companies do not use these paid services since they add up to their IT expenses. Besides, users too are wary of IT-backed MDM solutions, which can be misused by companies since they can read messages, check browsing history, and track device’s location.


For such users, Samsung’s Knox provides a mutli-layered solution, which is built into the device hardware of most high and mid-range Samsung smartphones. It allow users to create a “secure folder"", which uses encryption to create a secure area on the device where the user can keep their work apps, documents, photos and files locked away with a password or biometric data, such as iris or fingerprints. Apps in the secure folder are kept separately on the device and will not be visible to apps outside of it. It allows users to access their work apps without rebooting the smartphone. “The Knox platform can verify each piece of software that loads. If verification fails, Knox either records the tampering by flipping a one-time fuse called the Knox Warranty Bit, or prevents further booting,"" adds Jain.",1

"Shishir K. Bajoria, chairman of the SK Bajoria Group and one of the BJP’s Bengal leaders, claims that the reported violence is only 25% of reality, with counterclaims from the other side that some reports are grossly exaggerated. The BJP is using verbal, non-physical grammar to also stretch Mamata Banerjee’s political smarts to the limit. Nothing is beyond the pale of possible. In addition, the BJP has managed to get some key TMC members to cross the floor—former Lok Sabha member Mukul Roy and his strongman Arjun Singh (who is contesting against Trivedi) are a few examples.


There are strange calculations and ground-level alliances that defy explanation. A good example is Asansol, which has an interesting demographic profile. Asansol is part of Bengal’s famed industrial hub with coal mines and steel factories dotting the landscape. The population has many non-Bengali migrant workers employed in the various factories around the area. It also has close to 20% Muslim population. The electoral waters have been muddied by the shutdown of various factories in the area, including public sector units Burn Standard Co. Ltd (a railway wagon manufacturer) and Hindustan Cables Ltd.


Babul Supriyo, former junior minister in the ministry of heavy industry, had won the 2014 elections by over 70,000 votes and has been nominated by the BJP again. In contrast, Mamata has fielded former actor Moon Moon Sen, daughter of popular Bengali actor Suchitra Sen. Moon Moon had won from Bankura in 2014 but fielding her from Asansol has everybody mystified. A TMC party worker in Asansol commented in frustration: “She is like a 500-kg burden suddenly dropped on our backs.""


Some political analysts see this as Mamata’s gift to Babul; her calculations probably show Babul winning again and she is perhaps loath to waste an asset from here. Moon Moon is a convenient candidate who has already spent a five-year term in Lok Sabha. Conversely, she might be fielding Moon Moon to force local heavyweights to unite and abandon their factionalism which is supposed to have cost the TMC the Asansol seat last time.


This is evident from Moon Moon’s sparse public meetings, or her aversion to the heat-and-dust, rough-and-tumble of political campaigning, forcing the local organization to unite in the campaigning. In contrast, the BJP doesn’t have a strong or deep organizational presence in the region which then forces Babul Supriyo to often hit the road.


Moloy Ghatak, West Bengal law minister and Asansol resident, claims that Moon Moon Sen’s style of campaigning is different and far more intimate than her political rival.


Bengal’s 42 seats, in some ways, will determine many fates. For one, it might turn out to be pivotal for the BJP which is trying to retain its leading position. BJP general secretary Amit Shah has set a target of 23 seats, up from the earlier halfway mark of 22 seats. Mamata has been claiming that the TMC will get all 42, but some of that is election rhetoric.


Political analysts and other observers are convinced that the BJP’s vote share will definitely jump from last time’s 17%, but how that translates into seats will depend a lot on the granular data, in particular the configuration of the assembly constituencies that vote for the saffron party.


The consensus is the TMC will perhaps retain its leadership position, but the BJP will watch the voting pattern closely for a renewed assault during the 2021 Bengal assembly elections.",0

"The tide turned in 2018 when the budget brought back long-term capital gains. The markets were craving for a reason to correct and this was the perfect excuse for sentiment to turn. Yet the market still didn’t see a sharp decline. Instead, large-caps rose, taking the index higher during the year. Individual and professional portfolios having a rough time didn’t bother sentiment. SIP inflows, a traditional barometer of sentiment, simply rolled on. Most investors were confident that once large-caps peaked out, it would be the turn of smaller companies to regain their uptrend. But that was not to be.


The year 2019 started with successive bouts of selling in mid- and small-caps. Markets punished every little negative news from overvalued companies. Slowly, investors started losing confidence and were willing to sell. The pain was growing and they knew it would become unbearable. Past cycles had taught market players that much. But there were no buyers and stocks simply collapsed at the exit door. Even professional managers have not been able to stem the tide and their net asset values (NAVs) have been taking a regular knock even while the Sensex and Nifty stayed mildly positive in 2018. Yet in what seems to be unending pain, there’s no sight of a bottom. The usual signal of SIP redemptions remains elusive and the prediction of a market bottom is still waiting to be made. For, in the recent bull run, SIPs have begun to provide constant supply of capital to equities allowing investors to be far more patient than in the past cycles. Notional losses aren’t affecting investors as they previously did and this has spooked conventional thinking on a market bottom. But the last word is yet to be spoken. The current stock universe is deeply divided and we have both largely ignored parts and extremely concentrated fancy ones within indices like NBFCs, FMCG companies and private banks. In fact, the reason for the index rally is the spectacular rally in select stocks. The absence of selling has made these stocks safe havens and investors seem to be scampering to own them to avoid notional losses or NAV drawdowns on their portfolios.",3

2019 has too much at stake for Nagpur, which has remained centrist and secular—a character that is now changing


High dreamers leave Nagpur for Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. New migrants come in from Vidarbha, an aspirational class coveting upward mobility


This is the first general election without an Indian Coffee House in Dharampeth, Nagpur’s bustling shopping area. Two of this correspondent’s favourite Indian Coffee House outlets, among the oldest cooperative eatery chains from God’s own country, closed down in the orange city in two decades. Like many students from across Vidarbha, I came to Nagpur to study 30 years ago. In this period, many friends—the second, third or fourth generation Nagpurians—left here for better, greener pastures.


The four ever-smiling Malayalee brothers, who ran the small coffee house opposite the Panchsheel Cinema in Dhantoli, were warm and welcoming. They were migrants. In the British days, Dhantoli was called Craddock Town. It was Nagpur’s first planned modern civil residential area. Today it’s a mix of hospitals, commercial offices and residential apartments with no parking area. Suddenly one day in 2003, the brothers sold the shop. They made more money by selling the shop than they did by serving buttered toast, omelette, idli-dosa and coffee.


When the second one shut down in Dharampeth three years ago, Nagpurians lost another convenient gossip point. In elections, this was a place where you got the buzz from a city that’s right in the centre of India.


On 11 April, Nagpur goes to polls in the first phase of the 2019 general elections—it’s road transport, highways and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari’s home turf, which is now seeing the rise of his protégé and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Gadkari is seeking a re-election. A once Congress bastion, this historic town has seen a subtle tilt towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the last decade or so, thanks to a resurgent saffron party, a stronger Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and a divided and considerably weakened Congress.


If 2014 was a departure from the past, what will 2019 serve up? The results on 23 May would tell us that.


What is Nagpur voting for? Development, perhaps. To reclaim its place on the national map, maybe. A metro rail is coming up, cement roads are replacing tar roads, new malls are mushrooming and old structures are giving way to the new ones. Yet, Nagpur grapples with an identity crisis.


Nagpur’s textile mills and cloth centres that were its identity and drove much of its economy and politics for over a hundred years, shut down in the 1980s or 90s. Today’s branded garment stores sell ready-made clothes manufactured elsewhere. Nagpur wore its textiles, working classes and labour unions as emblems, punctuating its social, political and cultural life.


There was a time, old people recall, when Nagpur woke up and went to bed with mill sirens. “At 6, every morning, a siren from the Empress Mills in central Nagpur would go off and reach a crescendo, signalling the end of night shift,"" recalls octogenarian Diwakar Mohoni, writer, thinker and one of Nagpur’s veteran residents. As tired workers emerged from its gates, the city would wake up. At 2 in the afternoon and at 10 at night, sirens would signal lunch and bed time, he remembers.


Post liberalization, Nagpur began to dither as her textile mills shut down and handlooms fell silent. Suddenly there was no future. No new industry sprang up. The city relied on government offices, small services, but as the state and central governments began to cut back on its humongous staff, Nagpur began to search for new avenues. There are small information technology companies. Nagpur has a bit of everything but nothing quite substantial. It craves for a sector that will resurrect its fledgling economy that is today driven by small trading and retail.

"Shares of agrochemical companies with higher exposure to overseas markets have done relatively better than those with less exposure in fiscal year 2019.

"The number of women candidates in elections has increased over the years, but the likelihood of their victory has decreased over time, shows data


Last month, Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Naveen Patnaik declared that one third of the candidates fielded by his party in the upcoming general elections in Odisha would be women. This is part of a growing trend of greater female participation in Indian politics, in terms of female candidates at least. However, the success rate of these female candidates in winning seats remains poor.


The 2014 general elections saw 670 women candidates competing, a record-high and a 20% increase from 2009. This is part of a larger trend of more candidates being fielded. However, even as the total candidate pool has expanded, the ratio of women to men candidates has also increased. In 1984, for every 100 male candidates, there were three female candidates. By 2014, this figure had risen to nine, a significant improvement but still a very low figure


Actual women representation though has not kept pace with the increase in the number of women candidates. In 2014, the number of women members of parliament (MPs) was 63, another record-high but the success rate of women candidates was only 9.4%. This success rate has decreased dramatically from the 1960s when the number of women candidates were far fewer but they all had a higher chance of winning.",0

"Apple’s three big hardware markets — smartphones, personal computers and tablets — are stagnating. (Reuters)


Apple might also come up with a gaming service which is not aimed at Google's new Stadia cloud gaming platform


When Apple Inc. boss Tim Cook takes the stage at the Steve Jobs Theater in Silicon Valley on Monday, he will usher in a new era for the world’s largest technology company.


The chief executive officer is expected to unveil streaming video and news subscriptions, key parts of Apple’s push to transform itself into a leading digital services provider. The company may even discuss a monthly video games subscription. Likely absent from the event: Any new versions of the gadgets that have helped Apple generate hundreds of billions of dollars in profit since 1976.


It’s a particular challenge for Cook, who took over after Jobs died in 2011. The current CEO is an expert in hardware supply chains who spent years wrangling eager component manufacturers in Asia to assemble the company’s blockbuster iPhone. Apple’s newer partners — Hollywood studios, movie stars, newspapers and magazine publishers — are more wary of working with tech giants, or have already teamed up with rivals like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.


'This is a pivotal shift for Apple and in our opinion the biggest strategic move since the iPhone was unveiled in 2007,' said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. 'There is massive pressure on Cook and Apple to deliver on services, with streaming content a potential linchpin of growth.'


Apple’s three big hardware markets — smartphones, personal computers and tablets — are stagnating. To keep growing, the company has been trying to sell its existing device owners services such as Apple Music subscriptions, iCloud storage and AppleCare warranties.


On Monday, Apple will add video and news subscriptions, and could unveil a similar offering for credit cards. The company may also discuss combining all these digital services into a single bundle, similar to Amazon’s popular Prime program. Apple already has discussed the possibility of discounts for users who subscribe to more than one service.",1

Nationalist Congress chief (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj have already ruled themselves out of the race.


While Mayawati has ruled herself out keeping the interest of the nation in mind, Pawar is making way for the next generation in his family to contest and Swaraj has ruled herself out to due to health reasons.


“Seeing the needs of the current situation in the country and keeping the party’s momentum in mind, guided by the people and nation’s interest, it is best for me not to contest now. Keeping this in mind, I have decided not to contest these Lok Sabha elections for now,"" she said.",0

DHFL denied diverting loans to shell companies and said it had not received any communication from the government in relation to any investigation.

"Apple asked its suppliers late last month to produce fewer-than-planned units of its XS, XS Max and XR models, the Nikkei reported, citing sources with knowledge of the request.


The request was made before Apple announced its forecast cut, the Nikkei said. The bleaker sales outlook, which Apple attributed to weak China demand, triggered a broad sell-off in global stock markets.


Market research firm Canalys estimates shipments fell 12% in China last year and expects smartphone shipments in 2019 to dip another 3%, to below 400 million for the first time since 2014.


Overall planned production volume of both old and new iPhones is likely to be cut to a range of 40 million to 43 million units for January-March, from an earlier projection of 47 million to 48 million units, the Nikkei reported, citing one source familiar with the situation.

"Google will use more than 4,000 miles of cable, laid underwater, to connect the United States to Chile, home to the company’s largest data center in Latin America. (NYT)


Nearly 750,000 miles of cable connect the continents to support our insatiable demand for communication and entertainment


The internet consists of tiny bits of code that move around the world, travelling along wires as thin as a strand of hair strung across the ocean floor. The data zips from New York to Sydney, from Hong Kong to London, in the time it takes you to read this word.


Nearly 750,000 miles of cable connect the continents to support our insatiable demand for communication and entertainment. Companies have typically pooled their resources to collaborate on undersea cable projects, like a freeway for them all to share.


But now Google is going its own way, in a first-of-its-kind project connecting the United States to Chile, home to the company’s largest data centre in Latin America.


“People think that data is in the cloud, but it’s not,"" said Jayne Stowell, who oversees construction of Google’s undersea cable projects. “It’s in the ocean.""


Getting it there is an exacting and time-intensive process. A 456-foot ship named Durable will eventually deliver the cable to sea. But first, the cable is assembled inside a sprawling factory a few hundred yards away, in Newington, New Hampshire. The factory, owned by the company SubCom, is filled with specialized machinery used to maintain tension in the wire and encase it in protective skin.",1
"New digitally-enabled business models are the “platform"" models, which have both cost and revenue at each end. Suppliers and consumers are on both sides, are interchangeable, and matched by data and algorithms, according to Bindra. For instance, take the case of Airbnb, an asset-light, data-heavy platform model, as opposed to a Marriott, which is a “pipe"" model. When Marriott announced it would add 30,000 hotel rooms next year, Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky tweeted by saying that his company would add that in the next two weeks. This kind of scalability is confounding as it means massive disruption of the existing business model, says Bindra.


Traditional businesses need to embrace these disruptive business models, according to Bindra, who cites the example of Trringo, an “Uber for tractors"" set up by the tractors and farm equipment business of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to rent out the vehicles, as 90% of the time they were lying unused. Or take the instance of General Motors investing in platform models with Lyft, he says. Most legacy companies, cautions Bindra, tend to treat the online and offline worlds differently and have different products, pricing, look and feel for both —so, the online and offline customer experiences are remarkably different. However, “to act like a digital company, businesses have to think of the entire customer journey and map it, figure out delight and pain points in the journey, and use multiple digital interventions to make it more delightful, painless and seamless"", says Bindra.",1

"Apple isn’t expected to release a compatible iPhone this year, and even 2020 isn’t a sure thing, say market experts


Portland: Now that the first 5G devices are hitting the US market, Apple Inc. is under more pressure to start readying a comparable iPhone — or watch its dominance come under attack.


Already, Motorola Mobility Holdings has a quasi-5G phone out — it requires a snap-on module — and Samsung Electronics Co. will start selling its own version through Verizon Communications Inc. on 18 April. LG Electronics Inc. is planning to launch one at Sprint Corp. “very soon"" and is trying to accelerate the rollout of a model for Verizon, aiming to capitalize on the frenzy surrounding the ultrafast network technology.


In fact, all the big US handset sellers have shown, announced or launched 5G devices. All except Apple, the industry leader that accounts for nearly half the smartphone shipments in the US. The company isn’t expected to release a compatible iPhone this year, and even 2020 isn’t a sure thing.


“They can probably get by in 2019 without a 5G handset,"" wireless-industry consultant Chetan Sharma said. “But in 2020, if they don’t have a 5G handset, it could impact their market share. Not just in the US, but also other markets.""


It’s hard to gauge the risk for Apple if it’s a laggard in the 5G race. The company smoothly navigated relatively late transitions to 3G and 4G, though that was when the iPhone was still the hot new thing. 5G networks also still have to be built out, and the wireless signals are prone to interference. It’s no sure thing that consumers will embrace 5G by 2020, regardless of what Apple does. The early 5G phones will potentially be pricier and bigger than some of their slower counterparts, a short-term drawback to the technology.",1

In our department, we have okayed road work for ₹11 lakh crore (trillion), ₹5 lakh crore of shipping material and ₹1 lakh crore of water resources, ₹26,000 crore for Ganga, ₹40,000 crore for irrigation projects. We are consuming 40% of cement—are these not creating jobs? Construction equipment have doubled, does that not create jobs? It is a fact that some sectors are doing very well and some like agriculture are facing some problems because of global economy. Some policies have immediate effect, some mid term and some long term.

I think our party’s parliamentary board and party president will take a decision in this regard. Our party has always encouraged women’s participation.

We recently announced the PM-Kisan scheme where farmers will get ₹6,000 directly in their bank accounts. Fasal Bima Yojana is also working. We made loan provisions for ₹12 lakh crore in the priority sector. Agriculture export is also increasing. Certainly, this will have an impact.

"Once Washington has real evidence of risks that it can share with allies, it can put the security of the Huawei underwater cable operations on the international agenda with the same vigour it has applied in addressing the 5G concerns. This evidence would be the backbone of a strong strategic communications effort to persuade friendly governments and Western companies that working with Chinese won’t pay off in the long term. To some extent this is already happening — last year Australia banned Huawei from involvement in a cable it is subsidizing that will connect it to the Solomon Islands.


The US could also flex its technological muscles. Opportunities range from developing less costly alternatives in cooperation with the private sector that can pose price competition to the Chinese; innovating on means to test and protect the information on the cables Huawei Marine does eventually lay; and working to improve end-to-end encryption in all internet-based communications, which would make the task of compromising the security of the information on the cables much more difficult.

"In the seats that Prasad influenced, the sentiment among voters is that Tejashwi Yadav carries his father’s mantle “well"" but the baggage of RJD’s past, particularly family troubles and corruption charges, continue to dog the party.

“Lalu began with close relatives like Rabri Devi’s brother, Sadhu Yadav. His children still call Ram Kirpal Yadav (BJP MP from Patliputra and former close aide of Prasad) their uncle, but all his close aides have left him over time. Most of them were upset because he ran his family like a government, and the government like a family affair. These troubles have returned to haunt the family,"" said Bunty, who goes by one name and owns a homeware shop in Chapra.


Chapra, which falls within the Saran parliamentary constituency, symbolizes how internal family matters are impacting RJD’s electoral prospects. Prasad’s elder son, Tej Pratap , wanted his mother, Rabri Devi, to contest from Saran, a seat she lost to former Union minister and BJP member Rajeev Pratap Rudy in 2014. Instead, RJD fielded Chandrika Rai, Tej Pratap’s father-in-law, from the seat, a move Tej Pratap has publicly opposed as he recently filed a divorce petition in a Patna family court. Voters, even long-term Prasad supporters, fear the factionalism will sabotage the party’s chances in Saran.

Patna College’s Ranjan says people may miss Prasad, and may sympathize with him, but it is “purely sentimental"" and is unlikely to give RJD an electoral advantage. “Not everyone in the second rung of RJD’s leadership is okay to work under Tejashwi, largely because Lalu divided his party among his children and took no note of leaders who helped him build his party,"" said Ranjan.


While three phases of Bihar’s election still remain, the outcome of this election could decide the political fate of Prasad and the next generation of his family. Prasad cannot contest or campaign, but for voters in Bihar, who either love him or loathe him, he remains the politician who defined the state.


Summing up the sentiment on the ground, a voter in Gopalganj said: “You could never ignore Lalu. He was number one in whatever he did. Netagiri mei vikhyaat, chori mei vikhyaat (accomplished in realpolitik, accomplished in corruption).""",0

"Shapiro said the trade dispute with China and the Meng arrest in Canada aren’t impacting attendance. CES organizers on Sunday wouldn’t confirm numbers showing a sharp drop in Chinese exhibitors, but said a decline in small Chinese companies on the show floor was made up by expanded booth presence from bigger firms.


Chinese tech firms are increasingly joining their American, South Korean and Japanese counterparts in using CES to build enthusiasm for up-and-coming electronics products, while also connecting with potential new international partners and suppliers. That’s especially true for electronics firms like Hisense and TCL, which have increasingly sought to sell their TVs in North America, and Lenovo, which is already a big player in the US laptop market but is pushing to sell other internet-connected devices.


Hisense is making a splashier presentation this year as it invests in boosting its US brand awareness, said Jim Ninesling, head of marketing for Hisense USA. Previously, the company, which has a large market share in China, mostly kept on the US sidelines, branding some of its products under the name of the better-known Japanese firm Sharp.

Emerging economies dominate the list of oil-producing nations which is why they’re affected more than developed ones. The increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits, allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment. Winners include Saudi Arabia, Russia, Norway, Nigeria and Ecuador according to analysis by Nomura.


Those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies, which in turn would spark inflation. That in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options: hike interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight. Nomura’s losers list includes Turkey, Ukraine and India.

Weak sales volume, however, hurt profitability. As percent of sales, a 310-basis-point (bp) jump in raw material cost stemmed from a combination of low operating leverage and higher inventories. Fortunately, this was offset by lower employee costs and other expenses. As a result, Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin fell 30 bps to 7.1%.


This may, however, not go down well with investors, given the Street’s toned down forecast of a 7.6% Ebitda margin for the quarter. Likewise, the ₹308.1 crore Ebitda was about 8% lower than Bloomberg’s average estimate of 23 brokerages.",3

Yes, we picked the Note 5 Pro over the Note 6 Pro as there are no noticeable gains in performance between the two.

It comes with dual cameras at the back, which are electronically stabilised, and a lonesome selfie camera which is also perfectly adequate. The Note 5 Pro has a metal back, so it is susceptible to heating up more often than not.


It can handle PUBG at medium graphics at best and stutters a bit on high graphics. But at this price point, this is the best smartphone for bringing home Chicken Dinner.

Google has been privately testing Project Stream since last fall and just touted its announcement planned for Tuesday with a video trailer.

"Presume it will recall that whenever the opposition defined the dominant narrative, like in Bihar and Delhi, then it has worked to its advantage; conversely allowing Modi to define the electoral narrative implies that it will be the opposition that will play catch-up. What should also worry the opposition is that the guiding ideology of unity seems to be that of ""enemy’s, enemy (read BJP) is my friend"", which can never be the glue that holds alliances.


Further, it has been difficult to stitch one national alliance, with some political parties discovering that what is good for them nationally is not a good idea locally—in other words for short-term gains, they may end up hurting their long-term electoral interests in a state. This has been most manifest so far in alliance efforts in Uttar Pradesh—central to BJP’s success in 2014—and Delhi. Exactly why the ‘Mahagatbandhan’, or Grand Alliance, has not acquired the desired potential.


The opposition has also been handicapped by the fact that the Congress, the only national party with the potential heft to take on the BJP, is plumbing its worst lows in electoral politics; to be sure, it has recovered some of its mojo by clawing out wins in BJP’s heartland in Central India.",0

"However, it’s worth noting here that airlines have settled for lower passenger load factors in the bargain. IndiGo and SpiceJet saw their load factors drop 320-340 basis points on a year-on-year basis. Jet’s load factors declined marginally, supported to an extent by a decline in its capacity. One hundred basis points equal one percentage point.


Improving pricing at a time when load factors have dropped essentially means that the quality of traffic has improved, pointed out Deb of ICICI Securities. In short, passengers have had to pay more to travel.


Of course, not everything is hunky-dory. For instance, some analysts are concerned that SpiceJet’s profits were boosted by an unusual jump in its other operating income. IndiGo is facing a challenge because of a shortage of pilots, which is beginning to bite. “The scale of the problem is not large enough yet to warrant a cut in earnings estimates, although the situation needs close monitoring,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.

I used the Versa Lite for six days without running out of charge (with heart rate monitor on 24/7 and actively tracking workouts everyday for one to two hours). The battery life is great and so is its breathing guide. It isn’t an Art of Living session on your arm, but if you have two minutes to calm your nerves before a big presentation, this can do the trick.

"In Meghalaya, interestingly, although the BJP with two MLAs is part of the ruling alliance, it has decided to field candidates for both Tura and Shillong seats. This last-minute decision is inexplicable and apparently happened because the state BJP unit feels it should not let the seats go uncontested in favour of state-level allies. Sitting Congress MP Vincent Pala is contesting the Shillong seat and seems confident of winning it because of the disharmony created by the proposed CAB. Meghalaya and Assam suffer the brunt of illegal migration from Bangladesh and they feel strongly about the CAB. It’s a different matter that the issue seems to now have no impact in Assam, at least when it comes to voting the next batch of MPs. The NPP candidate from Tura, Agatha Sangma, has a formidable rival in the Congress’s Mukul Sangma, former chief minister of the state. Hence, while the Congress vote bank in Meghalaya is intact, the opposition coalition does not seem to have done itself any good with each party fielding its own candidates.


In Mizoram, the BJP will have no support overtly or covertly. T.B.C. Lalvenchhunga, 36, a former Navy sailor, was named as the candidate of a new political party—People’s Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram (PRISM). His central plank, if elected, is to move a private member bill in Parliament for the right to secession from the CAB, which seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from neighbouring countries but will not allow Mizos in the Chin state of Myanmar to visit Mizoram to see their relatives. The BJP is fielding Nirupam Chakma of the minority Chakma community for the state’s lone seat, while the Congress and Zoram People’s Movement will field a joint candidate, 41-year-old Lalnghinglova Hmar who has creditably put Mizoram on the football map of the country. Meanwhile, the ruling Mizo National Front has put up 61-year-old C. Lalrosanga who retired as the director general of Doordarshan as its candidate.


In Sikkim, DB Katwal, a youth leader, has been given the task of fighting the lone Lok Sabha seat under the aegis of the Sikkim Democratic Party, which is a coalition partner of the BJP. He has the blessings of the sitting MP, Prem Das Rai, an IIT-IIM alumnus and a man who has served the state well, participates actively in Parliament, and has been part of the success story of Sikkim. So, Katwal is expected to win the seat easily.


Coming to Arunachal Pradesh with two seats, it appears that in Arunachal West, Kiren Rijiju, the BJP MP and junior minister of homes affairs, will have a tough fight with formidable rivals Nabam Tuki and Jarjum Ete. Nabam Tuki is a former state chief minister, while Jarjum Ete is a well-known women’s activist who joined the Janata Dal (S) after being denied a ticket from the Congress. Pollsters aver that Rijiju might still get through in Arunachal West but that the Congress will trump over the BJP in the East.


In the final analysis, the BJP and its allies might at best get 15 seats and not 19-21 as claimed by Himanta Biswa Sarma recently at a press conference. The BJP is likely to get seven-eight seats in Assam; one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Nagaland; two each in Tripura and Manipur. However, these 15 seats from India’s farthest eastern corner could turn out to be crucial as the numbers get added up on 23 May 2019 in the run-up to government formation.",0

The ongoing election battle between the TMC and the BJP has largely been tagged as a contest between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Banerjee


RANAGHAT/BARDHAMAN/SERAMPORE: For 30-year-old businessman S.M. Imran, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a symbol of resistance against the steadily growing influence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has slowly become the main challenger to the electoral might of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).


The ongoing election battle between the TMC and the BJP has largely been tagged as a contest between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Banerjee.


The two have been taking potshots at each other for the last few weeks on the campaign trail. Banerjee, who was part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in the 1990s, has been on a collision course with the centre for a few years now, and is openly critical of Modi, his policies and programmes, and his mode of governance.


Modi, despite stating in a recent interview with Bollywood star Akshay Kumar that he’s on good terms with “Mamata didi"" and that she sends him kurtas and sweets every year, has been relentless in his criticism of Banerjee on the campaign trail. He called her “speedbreaker didi"" for holding up development projects and “sticker didi"" for “stamping central schemes with her name and distributing it in the state"", and has described the TMC government as an “aunt-nephew government"". Banerjee also hit back, called him “expiry babu"", and told him to “worry about Delhi first before turning your eyes towards Bengal"".",0

"Gaming is picking up in India partly because of mobile gamers. Teenagers playing on mobiles may get into competitive gaming as they grow up


When Mumbai-based Ankur Diwakar started playing games professionally in 2007, the country had little scope for such careers. Today, Diwakar has represented India in professional gaming tournaments (commonly called esports) and has even begun giving lectures in universities on how to take up esports as a viable career. According to Diwakar, while esports in India is not on a par with Asian standards yet, the gap is closing.


Part of the reason why gaming is picking up in the country is the rise of mobile gamers. While these gamers aren’t professionals like Diwakar, they help the overall community.


Games like PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s Battleground) Mobile have driven this. “If you look at the demographics of people playing on mobiles, they are 15-18 year olds.

In January, Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) proposed that Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) be formally included in the opposition alliance against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena combine. The proposal gained support after the BJP and Shiv Sena renewed their alliance in February. But the Congress rejected the idea, worried that the anti-migrant politics of MNS could become a liability in Mumbai constituencies, wherein there is a sizeable North Indian population. At MNS’s 13th Foundation Day rally on 10 March, Thackeray announced that the party will not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but will work towards making India “Modi and Amit Shah-mukt"".


Thackeray, arguably the best political orator in Maharashtra today, has been true to his word since then. He has held around 10 public meetings across the state, including some in Mumbai, where he has sought to “expose"" the lies of the Modi government. In terms of visual impact, media coverage and the election narrative in Maharashtra, Thackeray’s unconventional initiative has been a roaring success. In fact, his favourite line “laav re toh video"" (play that video) has become a rage. The BJP, however, has tried to hit back with old videos of Thackeray lavishly heaping praises on Modi.",0
"Momin, like many others, has left his hometown for a job in Pune, where he works in a startup. “There are jobs here in the traditional sectors like education or home-grown sugar and milk industry. But for engineers like me, Hatkanangale or even the larger Kolhapur district does not offer opportunities in modern sectors like IT or telecom,"" says Momin.


He feels the election narrative should be focused solely on development. “This government actually has something to show in terms of development, like roads and connectivity. But it is focusing on polarization.""


Hatkanangale votes along with 13 other constituencies in Maharashtra in the third phase of Lok Sabha elections on 23 April. Apart from jobs, Hatkanangale has long-running concerns like the farm crisis, something that it shares with nearly all other constituencies going to polls in this phase. The landscape is geographically diverse—Jalgaon and Raver in the Khandesh region; Aurangabad and Jalna in Marathwada; Raigad and Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg in Konkan; Madha in south Maharashtra; and Pune, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Hatkanangale, Ahmednagar, and Baramati in western Maharashtra.


These constituencies comprise some of Maharashtra’s most prosperous pockets though there are a few economic laggards as well. For instance, Pune, according to the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, government of Maharashtra, added ₹2.25 trillion of gross district value at current prices in 2016-17, which was the highest after Mumbai and Thane districts. But Jalgaon and Jalna added much lower ₹40,391 crore and ₹16,920 crore respectively during the same period. Like the economic disparity, there is social disparity as well. Pune, again, has the highest human development index (HDI)—0.814—after Mumbai at 0.841, as per the state economic survey of 2017-18. In fact, Pune, Raigad, and Sindhudurg are in the “very high"" HDI districts in Maharashtra. In contrast, Jalna is “low"" with 0.663.",0
"While, its design, display and port availability are its strengths, battery life can be a weakness for the Envy x360. If you’re trying to run games, the laptop won’t last much longer than 3-4 hours. However, you can continuously watch 1080p movies for over 5 hours with the screen brightness turned to about 50%. For word processing purposes, the laptop runs up to about 7.5 hours.


Now, while this isn’t bad battery life per se, it’s not the best an ultrabook can offer. For a class of laptops that’s known to offer at least 10 hours battery life, this might be deemed a weakness for the Envy X360.


For Rs. 60,999, the HP Envy x360 is a good laptop for those whose requirements are simple — typing, web browsing, watching movies. If you need something for editing software (video or photo) or other resource intensive tasks, we’d recommend looking at Intel-powered counterparts, some even from HP itself.


Thin and light laptops are usually expensive, so the HP Envy x360 lies on the cheaper side of that segment. It’s certainly worth considering.

"The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) overwhelming victory in 2014 sparked claims of a change in the Indian voter’s mindset. Many claimed that the 2014 results showed that voters were now driven by an agenda of broad-based and inclusive development rather than caste and religion. However, a new study by Abhijit Banerjee, Amory Gethin, and Thomas Piketty, published by the Economic and Political Weekly, debunks these claims and shows how identity and religious-ethnic conflicts, rather than economic issues and social policy, determine India’s electoral choices.


Comparing data from national and state elections between 1962 and 2014 with electoral surveys and social spending data, the authors classify the support base and votebank for parties across the ideological spectrum. They find that the BJP and other right-wing parties, such as the Shiv Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal, have drawn their support from the Brahmins and other forward castes. On the other hand, the Congress, centre-left and left parties have drawn their support from Muslims and lower caste Hindus.",0

In Alexa's privacy settings, the company gives users the option of disabling the use of their voice recordings for the development of new features. A screenshot reviewed by Bloomberg shows that the recordings sent to the Alexa auditors don’t provide a user’s full name and address but are associated with an account number, as well as the user’s first name and the device’s serial number.

"This would also be in line with some of OnePlus’ claims in older devices. The company has famously stuck to 1080p displays so far, arguing that they allow higher frame rates while gaming. Since the 7 Pro is also expected to hit 2K resolution, it’s likely that the higher frame rates will let OnePlus split the difference.


Having said that, not many regular users will spot the difference between a 60Hz (which is the usual for smartphones) and 90/120Hz display. Moreover, there’s really very little content available for phones today (games or otherwise) that can take advantage of such high frame rates.


It’s also worth noting that higher frame rates mean more resource consumption. Given OnePlus’ software prowess, one could expect that the company will limit the display to pumping out high frame rates only when required.


Next, the OnePlus 5G is expected to become one of the first phones to support 5G connectivity. This, of course, has less to do with OnePlus and more to do with Qualcomm. The company’s flagship Snapdragon 855 chipset supports 5G data connectivity.

"1) The rupee’s recent pullback against the US dollar has been partly attributed to a softening in global crude oil prices from recent highs.

"Here's how you can take Google's help in suggesting you hotels, flight tickets during your next vacation... or turn it off


In the world of luxury travel, two superpowers currently prevail above all: personalization and intuition. The better a hotel, app, or travel company can respond to users’ needs and desires—and ideally, predict them before they bubble up to the surface—the more likely they are to gain a loyal following.


But it’s not a hotel or travel agency that’s cracking the golden acorn. It’s Google. The tech titan is leveraging its immense artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities to boost its travel offerings, which currently cover everything from flight and hotel search to activity recommendations, destination guides, and mapping services.


Travel tech expert Gillian Morris, founder of airfare search app Hitlist, says this is a space in which Google is uniquely positioned to succeed. “One reason why it’s so hard to innovate and give satisfying experiences in the travel industry is that companies rarely know anything about you; you don’t log in to Kayak or Expedia so that they can learn what you like,"" she explains. “Personalization is difficult when you don’t have a clear picture of the traveller. But Google has so much info through your email, flight confirmations—everything—they actually can deliver that magical trip experience.""


The proof is in the pudding. Over the past few months, Google has quietly launched an array of travel-focused features and updates that highlight just how intuitive its AI technology has become. Put them all together and you’ll have enough reason to believe your next travel agent might just be a Google-powered bot.",1

"In Kaspersky case, the company sold software to the US govt, when officials expressed concern about privacy


Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese telecom giant facing multiple criminal indictments in the US, is expanding on a Russian company’s failed legal argument to bolster its claim that American authorities have gone too far in trying to protect national security.


In a federal lawsuit filed this week in Texas, Huawei claims a US ban on government purchases of its equipment violates the Constitution and could kill the company. The restrictions were imposed in 2018 because American authorities determined there was a risk Huawei products could be used by China for illegal surveillance.


While the courts last year shot down a similar protest by Russian software maker Kaspersky Lab, Huawei contends its case is different because the ban was expanded to include anyone doing business with the government. Legal experts say the lawsuit is a long shot, but the company’s argument is part of its aggressive campaign to combat US allegations of bank fraud, technology theft and spying.

The NASA programme that we have (called Valkyrie) is an example. Sophia is another example where they’ve exploited signal processing and the conversational agent side of things quite well. But if you look at Sophia itself, it’s templatized. It cannot actually use hands and legs to pick up things, and make decisions.


We see a big gap between the science fiction side of things and achieving reality. It’s very important that people understand not just the capabilities of AI and robotics, but also the limitations. Without this understanding, we may jump into deploying systems that are not reliable.


The emphasis in India, I would say, would be more towards using robots and AI technologies in improving the efficiency of doing things. Just like we use laptops and other devices to carry out tasks, as opposed to typewriters, I think of robotics and AI as an enabling tool for improving efficiency. And in the context of India, it is not about taking people out of jobs but actually using these technologies as a way of augmenting their skills--either to do what they’re doing with higher efficiency, or enabling them to do things that were not feasible before from a human perspective.

"Some people will highlight this as a deal-breaker. However, the notch did little to harm sales of the iPhone X, and its existence allowed Apple and Huawei to bake in advanced facial recognition features, which map the human face to unlock the phone and certain apps.


The Mate 20 Pro includes one feature neither Apple nor Samsung used: a fingerprint sensor built into the screen itself. However, with the industry moving away from fingerprint security—Apple ditched it entirely for the iPhone X—this addition is unlikely to sway too many buyers.


Physically all three models are slightly different. Apple’s is the thinnest, with a depth of 7.7mm, but because Huawei gave its model a taller screen it was able to make its phone narrower, at 72mm across compared with the Phone’s 77.4mm. Smaller hands may benefit from the Mate 20 Pro’s design as a result.


Apple and Samsung’s models both include two camera lenses to the rear—one wide-angle, one telephoto—which capture pictures at a resolution of 12 megapixels.

"Raj Thackeray was deep in love with PM Modi and the “Gujarat model” through 2013-14. However, the unalloyed bhakt has turned a ferocious antagonist, a hard-hitting challenger


Despite not fielding a candidate, Raj Thackeray has almost overnight become the main opposition voice in Maharashtra. What’s his game?


Ae, laav re to video (Hey, just play that video),"" declares Raj Thackeray, 51, to one of his many assistants on the dais. On a large screen behind him, a video starts playing a chosen clip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi making promises or announcing a scheme. Thackeray exhorts his audience, packed to the gills in public maidans in towns and cities across Maharashtra, to listen with care. Then, as the video fades out, Thackeray demolishes Modi’s statements with the precision of a statistician, investigation of a journalist, and passion of a politician.


By the end of his 40-45 minutes speech peppered with video evidence, data, and clever use of Marathi idioms, Thackeray has left the people with enough information and perspective to make them question Modi and their vote for him. Thackeray first unveiled this pattern with his annual Gudi Padwa (Maharashtrian New Year on 6 April) rally at Mumbai’s Shivaji Park. In the following two weeks, he spoke at large and responsive rallies in Nanded, Satara, Ichalkaranji, Pune, Solapur, and Raigad, and would do encores in half a dozen more towns and cities before campaigning in the state ends.


His team finds it difficult now to accommodate requests for rallies that pour in every day. Marathi channels have chosen to show his rallies live (one even cut Modi’s to show Thackeray’s), his party’s social media handles have seen an uptick, short clips of his speeches are clogging tens of WhatsApp groups, and every subsequent live-streaming of a rally has garnered higher YouTube audiences. (Over the weekend, the Election Commission denied Thackeray permission for more rallies in Mumbai—his team said the Bharatiya Janata Party had brought pressure on it—but later acceded).


Thackeray’s pattern is to call out Modi-Shah for their “fakery, lies, publicity blitzkrieg, and dictatorial tendencies"". He uses their videos and statements of the past five years, to show the “wide gap"" between their assertions and reality (for instance, on Modi’s claim of building 850,000 toilets in Bihar in a week or Harisal village being India’s first digital village and so on). Thackeray warns his audience that India cannot suffer the Modi-Shah duo’s “dictatorial Hitler-like"" rule for the next five years. He then advises them to “vote out this duo, vote wisely"".


Thackeray does not ask for votes in favour of any candidate. On 6 April, he only said there’s no harm in trying out Rahul Gandhi as prime minister—a huge turnaround considering his anti-Nehru-Gandhi attitude. Thackeray has not fielded a single candidate of his 13-year-old party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), for any of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state. So, what’s his game? How should we read him?",0

"The lack of any obvious white spaces is also evident in the startup world. Growing a business is getting more expensive and funding rounds are trending upwards. In 2008, less than 4% of series C rounds were over $50 million. By 2017, close to 20% of all series C rounds were above that number. Almost a third of all series D rounds in 2017 were above $50 million, up from just 4% in 2008. Startup founders are also skewing older, signalling that experience and specialization are needed to solve the harder problems (Chart 2).


The rise of mega-large funds, of which the Vision Fund is the most visible example, is another indication that investors have fewer ideas on which to place their bets. In a marketplace with limited ideas, the few startups that achieve scale can command inflated valuations.


The futurist Roy Amara stated that human tendency is to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The first industrial revolution gave us steam engines and railroads. The second industrial revolution was built on the commercialisation of electricity and the internal combustion engine. In both those case, it took almost 50-60 years for their effects to work through the system.


Perhaps something similar is at play. We are in the lull phase before the next wave. History suggests that a series of incremental innovations ultimately lead to major advances. With A.I, big data and automation, we are perhaps building the plumbing for tomorrow’s innovation. Extrapolating from today’s technology perhaps limits our comprehension of what could be possible.


But in the interim, we have to be content with the little things. As one commentator put it memorably, “SF [San Francisco] tech culture is focused on solving one problem: What is my mother no longer doing for me?"".


The past two decades have seen tech firms burst on the economic landscape, turning ‘innovative’ ideas into businesses. With new-age tech such as AI and ML at their disposal, they have garnered skyrocketing valuations as well.


The ‘innovation’ achieved in recent years appears diminutive, compared with the giant leaps enterprises took some 200 years ago that fundamentally changed the way we live, travel, communicate and eat today.


We are probably in the lull phase before the next wave. History shows that a series of incremental innovations ultimately lead to major advances. Perhaps something similar is at play in the world of tech and innovation.

“District hospitals—whether public or private—can charge nominal to reasonable fees to be affordable.

The cost of delivery—which, in India, is actually 1/10th of the cost in western countries, for the same quality—is still too high for most Indians,"" he says. Worldwide, the safety net is provided by insurance so India can build this architecture in the next three to five years.

Also, the new assembly line in its Gujarat plant brings with it higher depreciation charges. Fortunately, higher depreciation in the March quarter was partially offset by lower interest costs and relief on tax due to a write-back of earlier provisions and higher other income from investments. As a result, the net profit drop of 4.6% year-on-year was not as severe as the drop in Ebitda, and in-line with what analysts had estimated.


While Maruti Suzuki may not be alone in battling several headwinds, the uncertainties around sales, profits and margins are likely to keep the stock range-bound. True, Maruti Suzuki’s shares are down 33% from a year ago, but its strong leadership position in the market is hard for any competitor to crack.

"Selecting 20% of households for an unconditional monthly allowance of ₹6,000 is likely to be a chaotic and divisive exercise (Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times)


Here is a scary but plausible scenario for the Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY). If there’s a Congress-led coalition government at the centre later this year, a committee will be asked to suggest ways of identifying the poorest 20% households for the purpose of giving them ₹6,000 per month each.


This committee will recommend some sort of scoring system based on household characteristics. To implement this, a Socio-Economic Census will be conducted soon after the Census 2021—much as with the Socio-Economic and Caste Census of 2011, but with “caste"" discreetly dropped since nothing came of it last time.


The entire exercise will create a new class of households that enjoy a monthly allowance roughly equivalent to full-time employment at the minimum wage. Some of them will come from highly vulnerable groups, but others not, because of the unreliable nature of this identification exercise. For the same reason, many poor households will be left out.


Discontent will spread, tensions will simmer, and the whole scheme will be considered by many as a gross injustice —anyay rather than nyay. Five years down the line, in 2024, the Congress will pay the price for this chaos in the next genera elections.


This is not, of course, the only possible scenario. And even in this pessimistic scenario, many poor people will live better lives.


If I bring it up, it is to illustrate the fact that the operational aspects of NYAY are not an incidental matter, as some proponents of the minimum income guarantee scheme seem to suggest.


I am also drawing attention to the potential “divisiveness"" of NYAY. This concern arises from a combination of relatively low coverage (20% of the population) and large benefits—many times larger than anything being provided to poor people today under any scheme. Shocking as it may sound, ₹6,000 per month is the sort of salary that many informal-sector workers earn in the poorer states—say chowkidars (watchmen) or domestic workers. People struggle, bribe, cheat and fight for jobs of this kind.


Selecting 20% of households for an unconditional monthly allowance of ₹6,000 is likely to be a chaotic and divisive exercise.",0

Coming back to the election, several sitting MPs were not given seats. Is there any fear of dissidence?


Initially, when we took such a big risk, our most seniors leaders were angry that all of them had been dropped. Not a single senior MP has re-contested. That was a huge fear. Some voluntarily said that they did not want to contest. Others were interested in contesting but were not allowed, so there was fear.

This time my own assumption is based on four-five things, the brand Modi image continues to be popular; after the Balakot air strikes his popularity has increased. Now people of North-East relate the name of PM Modi with development. People can see the change in North-East. The entire national highway network is being rejuvenated, railway track has been transformed and now dual track is being laid. Basically, railway, highway and airway, these three are the brightest spots from the development point of view. These have been the best years for North-East. Prime Minister’s flagship programmes like Ujjwala have benefitted. North-East has been in the grip of corruption for long, money coming from Delhi used to not reach the remotest village but today because of direct benefit transfer (DBT) people are getting 100% money, whether it is for construction of house or for any other purpose. So, Brand Modi with the message of development is helping BJP.


Prior to 2014 general elections, it was only Brand Modi. People wanted change and dethrone Congress, so it was a mandate for change. But post 2014 polls, we have district committees, booth committees.

"What's missing in the XR is a second rear lens for double the magnification. Instead, the XR uses software zoom, which reduces quality. Of course, the standard iPhone 7 and 8 didn't have a second lens either, although their Plus models did, as did the iPhone X. Both XS models also have two lenses. Despite lacking a second lens, the XR lets you blur backgrounds in some shots, a feature many phones are now getting. The XR does this with software, though it works only with people in the foreground, while the XS can do statues and monuments.


Two more points of comparison. The XS has slightly better water resistance — good to a depth of 2 meters (2.2 yards), compared with just 1 meter on the XR. But the XR offers a budget storage-upgrade option: $50 for 128 gigabytes (up from 64 gigabytes in the base model). Both XS phones also start at 64 gigabytes, but their cheapest upgrade is $150 for 256 gigabytes.


The only knock is the XR's size. Though it's fine for people with adequate pockets or bags, not everyone wants a phone that's nearly as wide as the Max or the Plus. Perhaps Apple will one day design a smaller XR and revive a trend of offering both standard and larger versions for each major model.

"Early this week, US-based news portal BuzzFeed uncovered an ad scam controlled by a network of shell companies located in eastern Europe. They were reportedly using a front, We Purchase Apps, to buy legitimate apps, available on Google Play Store, from their developers to gain control over 125 apps with combined download of 115 million.


These shell companies ran the apps like before so no one would suspect anything, while they carefully analysed the behaviour of the apps’ human users. The data was then used to model a huge network of botnets pretending to be actual users, according to Protected Media, a cybersecurity firm hired by BuzzFeed to investigate the matter. With the army of botnets, they managed to show an inflated number of users to advertisers. They also managed to bypass the fraud detection tools, put in place by advertisers and Google.


In an official blog post Per Bjorke, Product Manager, Ad Traffic Quality, confirmed that the information furnished by the news portal helped them identify the ad scam targeting apps and websites that were monetizing with numerous ad platforms, including Google. “We have removed apps involved in the ad fraud scheme so they can no longer monetize with Google.

"Sometimes the answer to whether it’s worth moving from Samsung to Apple or vice-versa is the same regardless of which phones are being considered: can you be bothered (or afford) to re-buy all your favorite apps? This is no less true with the Note 9 and iPhone Xs Max. This alone may be a deal-breaker for many.


But the iOS ecosystem has recently expanded its already well-regarded catalog of apps to include advanced augmented-reality tools. You can measure furniture accurately thanks to the iPhone’s rear-facing camera array, and this has opened the door to home furnishing apps that can help users virtually place potential purchases in their apartments. The larger screen on Apple’s new phone is likely to make this an even more attractive area of software and e-commerce to invest in, and it’s not something Android-powered devices can universally achieve the same results with.


However, the Note 9 can do something far removed from anything its rival can currently offer, which is to become — for all intents and purposes — a PC. Using a cable, the device can be connected to a monitor and run desktop applications as would be expected on a laptop. A mouse and keyboard can be hooked up via Bluetooth. It’s still Android, not Microsoft Corp.’s Windows, but that could be enough for some people who want one device to rule all working environments. It’s an innovative and powerful feature that Samsung executes well.


One of the most controversial aspects of comparing an iPhone to an Android-powered device like the Note, is performance. There are huge numbers of variables, from the efficiency of the operating system itself and the speed and architecture of the hardware and memory, to the apps installed. But both Apple and Samsung’s flagships contain some of the most cutting-edge silicon available to mobile products, with specifications and raw horsepower that mirror — or exceed — those of many laptops. It’s because of this that Samsung’s desktop PC features, for example, are possible.


Apple’s hardware-software ecosystem is tighter than Samsung’s. The Cupertino, California-based company designs its own hardware, its processors, the software operating system, and strictly ensures third-party developers stick to its guidelines when making apps for consumers. This has historically been seen to give iPhones an edge in terms of performance consistency.",1

"But perhaps KCR’s masterstroke was the ‘Rythu Bandhu’ input subsidy scheme, under which all land-owning farmers get ₹4,000 per acre for both the rabi and kharif crop seasons every year. The programme is believed to have helped him win the 2018 assembly elections.


Naidu’s decision to move out of Hyderabad and create a new state capital, Amaravati, has also kept him busy since 2015, more so as he had to raise funds to set up the infrastructure. “We started with a deficit of ₹16,000 crore in AP.

"The findings are revealing: Facebook commenting activity went through the roof around the end of February as Indians and Pakistanis fought a protracted online battle to dominate the narrative post the Pulwama attack; some comments on the platform are as popular as the posts on pages with millions of followers; and sycophantic amateur poetry is a popular form of comment.


On Monday, Facebook took down over 700 pages for repeatedly engaging in “coordinated inauthentic behaviour"" aimed at influencing India’s elections. Both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were implicated, apart from the Inter-Service Public Relations wing of the Pakistani military. The activity that was under scrutiny was posts, while comments still fall outside any sustained monitoring.


But purely based on traction and audience footprint, the comment thread is a publishing platform on its own. According to India Digital News Report 2019 by Reuters Institute, a third of the English-language Indian news users comment on online news. Unlike a status update on one’s personal profile, the visibility of a top comment on a large Facebook page goes well beyond a user’s own social network. Still, when information dissemination via social media is discussed, comments are largely ignored. They can be crucial.


Contrarian voices—which don’t always stick close to facts—feature prominently in the comment spaces of many controversial posts on Facebook pages with millions of followers, breaking the traditional hierarchy between content creators with a large following and ordinary users. What fetches the most comments: Controversial statements by celebrities, tall claims by politicians, and tragic news reports.


Politicians’ pages bagged the most number of comments per post. Engagement on their posts dwarfs the commenting activity on others. For instance, the average number of comments on Narendra Modi’s page was 5,449; it was over 500 for other politicians. That figure was less than 20 for every media page. Partisan political pages fell in between.


The number of comments matter. In January 2018, Facebook changed its news feed algorithm: the company will “prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people"", the announcement blog post read, adding, “posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to"" will be shown higher up in the feed.


But “back-and-forth discussion in the comments"" doesn’t necessarily translate into “meaningful interactions""—it is not even clear what “meaningful"" means. The tone and style of top comments vary significantly by page type, language, and the audience the page attracts. The game is to rise to the top.


To cut through the thousands of comments and feature as “most relevant"", the content needs to be contrarian; share a powerful personal anecdote; be witty or sarcastic; crack a joke; argue with shayari; use hashtags; post a meme. There is no fixed formula.


On media pages, politicians across party lines are extensively challenged. Among the top comments are those who counter a politician’s claim by claiming direct knowledge of the issue at hand, or have a personal stake in the story.",0

The first products that are cutting edge are always expensive. But they all become more affordable over time. In the same way, great audio was extraordinarily expensive 15 years ago. Now you can get good audio at a more affordable price. When I think about the latest headphones trends like becoming truly wireless —they’re expensive because they have the most cutting edge components inside them, miniaturization costs, etc. But over time as you produce more, the volume comes and mass adoption happens, the price reduces.

The state’s politics is a complicated maze of caste, sub-castes and religion. It lags on several social, health and demographic parameters. Caste complexities, coupled with various social evils and rampant anti-social activities, make the state among the most difficult to govern.

"Once the SIM swap request is initiated, the operator sends an SMS for authentication and users have to acknowledge it by tapping a single key or a bunch. The hacker will tell users in advance about this SMS so the latter easily falls for it.


According to reports, a Pune man lost ₹93,000 in a SIM swap scam in November. In June, a Kolkata-based woman reportedly fell for a similar hoax call and had ₹70,000 swiped from her bank account within a few hours. Once the SIM swap is complete, the original SIM will be deactivated and the number will be active on the duplicate SIM owned by the hacker.


The second method is “SIM swapping in person"" and is likely to be used by small-time cybercriminals. In this case an impostor will visit an operator’s retail outlet with fake documents pretending to be the actual customer and try to get a duplicate SIM card issued.


Another way to take control over a person’s mobile number is through SIM cloning, but that requires the hacker to have physical access to the SIM card to break the encryption keys and extract the IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) number—a unique 15 digit code that identifies the SIM to the GSM (global system for mobile communications) network. Unlike SIM swapping, in this case both the original SIM and cloned SIM remain active simultaneously.",1
"Investor optimism about margin expansion stems from multiple factors. In the near term, with cost reined in over the last three years, BHEL’s margins will get a fillip. Staff costs, the big bane that dragged the power equipment maker’s margins down when the economic slowdown struck about five years ago, had bloated as a proportion of sales. Now, after the sharp employee reduction, costs are trending lower. Also, provisioning and other related expenses have hit a trough.


On another front, increase in executable order book, which has nearly doubled in the past year, brings good tidings. Revenues are expected to expand and operating leverage will aid margins. One might recall that three-fourths of BHEL’s power sector orders accrued from state government distribution companies (power discoms) and a few long-gestation projects. This resulted in delayed payments, elongated working capital cycle and high debtors position. This is slowly changing after three quarters of revenue contraction until Q2 FY18.


Going by history, analysts are hopeful of a revival in power sector orders after elections. In FY19, order flows are estimated at about ₹30,800 crore, which represents a 25% contraction from the previous year.",3

"Pulwama and the subsequent Balakot airstrikes have failed to impress farmers who want the centre to focus on issues that directly affect them (Satish Bate/Hindustan Times)


Gujarat still seems to be stuck in the clear rural-urban divide of 2017. Will Pulwama and Balakot make a difference?


In 2014, the BJP won all 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat. But the situation seems to have changed. While the BJP still holds sway in urban areas, rural distress has the saffron party on edge


Ahmedabad: On the eve of elections, the mood in many parts of Gujarat is deeply conflicted. “They (central government) attacked us with everything they could. First came note bandi (demonetization), which threw our lives completely out of gear… then came GST (goods and services tax),"" says Mahesh Prajapati, who runs a pharmacy in Ahmedabad’s middle-class Memnagar locality.


But Prajapati is quite certain that he will still vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “See, whatever are the other issues, after (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi, riots have stopped in Gujarat. The Muslims have been shown their place. See what he (Modi) did after Pulwama. Pakistan has been taught a lesson. In these circumstances, we have to vote intelligently. Other issues can wait,"" he explains.


Understandably, the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, under which Memnagar falls, is expected to be a walkover for BJP president Amit Shah. L.K. Advani represented the seat for five consecutive terms (1998-2014) before being eased into the party’s euphemistic retirement abode—the Margdarshak Mandal.


Most of the slogans in Amit Shah’s massive roadshows have had nothing to do with either the state or the constituency. “Kashmir Hamara Hain (Kashmir is ours)"" is a popular one. Across urban Gujarat, large hoardings of Narendra Modi’s face with the accompanying slogan “Attacked terrorists inside enemy’s homes"" dot the landscape. Several cities have witnessed special screenings of Uri: The Surgical Strike.


Cut to Saurashtra’s rustic belt around Mendarda town in the Porbandar Lok Sabha constituency, which is a mere 300 kilometres away from the state capital, and it’s a different world altogether.

"Various pre-poll surveys and our own assessment suggest that the NDA is unlikely to get 73 seats in Uttar Pradesh and you may be losing some 30 seats. There may be losses in some other states including Maharashtra. Overall, if you fall short of 40-50 seats, which are the states where you think the BJP will make up for those likely losses?


Firstly, I don’t agree that we will lose 30-40 seats in UP. We will not. Secondly, the entire North-Eastern belt is coming to the BJP. That includes West Bengal. Don’t be surprised if we get more than 20 seats in West Bengal. Odisha looks good. Even in Tamil Nadu, our alliance is doing well. In Maharashtra, my sense is that the political situation is so favourable to us that we will win more than 42 seats. The situation is so favourable that if we lose a seat or two, it will be due to our inability to not handle that particular seat politically. People have decided to vote us back.


We have had three phases and if one looks at the BJP campaign so far, it looks like a constantly shifting narrative and course correction. If it was Indo-Pak in the first phase, it shifted to development in the second. Then, ahead of the third, you introduced the hard Hindutva factor in the campaign by nominating Pragya Singh Thakur from Bhopal. Why this flip-flop?


No no, I think our campaign has been quite consistent. In fact, our campaign has been so consistent that it sounds repetitive to us because we are the ones repeating the same themes at every place but people respond because the audience changes from constituency to constituency. The campaign has largely been consistent but what happens is that someone like Sidhu (Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu) says something controversial somewhere and that becomes the issue of the day and we have to respond. Someone else says something controversial and so on. Political agenda is obviously there in all such statements and it becomes the issue of the day. Other than that, there has not been any need for us for course correction and there is no course correction. Everything is going according to the plan.",0

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has sought to drive electronics producers into manufacturing locally by steadily moving tariffs up the supply chain from simple phone cases to sophisticated chipsets and boards.


Along with local firms like Lava, global smartphone giants including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Oppo and Xiaomi Corp have responded aggressively, investing millions of dollars in plants around Bengaluru and Delhi tech hub Noida.


Apple is the only major player which does not manufacture phones in the country and it only assembles two low-cost older models through Wistron Corp in Bengaluru.


Industry experts say as a result the company still imports about 70-80% of its phones. That results in high import duties, which in turn make the phones expensive.


In the United States, the basic iPhone XR model costs $749 or roughly ₹ 54,400, only two thirds of its retail price in India. Beyond that, while US phones are subsidized under deals with wireless carriers, Apple’s phones in India are not.

Your data is crunched along with data from millions of other users so that the firms’ algorithms can learn and make sure Google and Facebook show us ads right at the moment when we may be most open to considering buying those products or services.


It is this data—which we give away for free—that generates vast profits and makes a small number of smart people extraordinarily wealthy while the rest don’t get anywhere. There is a massive transfer of wealth taking place in our economies that may lead to a disturbingly inegalitarian future.

The 5GE icon on a phone screen will inform them they have speeds that are faster than the current 4G networks, and the 5G indicator will mean they are getting the fastest speeds possible, he said.


Also unclear is how much it will cost for people to buy 5G access — and whether the tremendous speeds will encourage consumers to burn through their cellular data faster than they did with slower technologies. The carriers have yet to announce pricing for data plans using 5G.


Phones have become costly, in some cases exceeding $1,000. Can we expect prices to continue climbing?


Samsung has not announced pricing of the Galaxy S10 5G, though the device is expected to top $1,000, in part because of its 5G compatibility and depth-sensing camera lens.


For Samsung’s phones with more incremental changes, prices are also up. Prices start at $750 for the Galaxy S10E, $900 for the S10 and $1,000 for the S10 Plus. Compare that with the S9 and S9 Plus, which started at $720 and $840.


Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said she was doubtful that prices could go up much more in the near-term. The $749 iPhone XR, which despite rave reviews has not sold as robustly as some had anticipated, demonstrated that consumers may have hit a threshold.

"The fact that developers are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to make their apps intelligent and enhance user experiences, is also one of the reasons impacting the life span of older apps. Google, for instance, discontinued the “News and Weather"" and “Play Newsstand"" apps to offer an AI-powered News app built from scratch. AI-enabled Google Assistant, on its part, has replaced Google Now. The decision to kill an app can be influenced by many reasons, so its cannot be said that its demise was related to incorporating AI into apps’ system, says Sachin Dev Duggal, founder and CEO, Engineer.ai. However, he adds, that there is a likelihood of that happening in case of apps that don’t utilize modern day tools like AI across the life cycle of their business.


The rollout of the General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) in the European Union, too, is another factor since apps have to protect the data privacy of individuals and be more transparent, failing which they will have to pay a heavy penalty.

From the previous budget on 1 February, 2018, till date the markets have not improved much as the Sensex rose 1.57% while the BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap fell 15.23% and 25.47%, respectively. Fears of a global slowdown, high crude oil prices and a weak rupee weighed on equities.

"“Not much should be read in this decision because the party leadership had taken a decision earlier that leaders above 75 years should not hold any public office. The decision does not mean that the party has forgotten the contribution of the senior leaders. The decision is to look at the future,"" said a senior BJP leader in the know of the developments, requesting anonymity.


The trend is visible across the country.

At Madha in Solapur district, NCP workers and sympathizers offer different reasons for Pawar’s withdrawal from the fray—in March, Pawar hinted he may contest from here but later took a step back in favour of his grand-nephews Parth and Rohit Pawar, who is likely to contest assembly election later this year. Nana Bhange, NCP worker in Madha, says there is no question of Pawar sensing defeat in Madha and hence withdrawing. “(Pawar) Saheb cannot lose from anywhere in Maharashtra. But if he had contested, he would have been stuck campaigning in Madha and wouldn’t have been able to campaign for others in the state,"" Bhange says. His colleague from the NCP, who requested anonymity, however, added that Pawar had developed apprehensions about the contest after sensing intense factionalism within NCP.

NSE’s volatility index (India VIX), often referred to as a fear gauge, surged to a three-year high of 24.6 on Tuesday.

He is jobless and blames the state government which is yet to announce a recruitment drive for school teachers. “For a primary school teachers’ position ₹8-10 lakh bribe is common. This government needs to be taught a lesson.""


Purulia goes to polls on 12 May, in the sixth phase of the elections. This underdeveloped constituency in many ways encapsulates the poll battle in West Bengal. In 2014, the TMC candidate won the seat with a margin of over 153,000 votes, defeating the Left front candidate. the BJP candidate ranked fourth, polling just 7% of votes compared to the TMC’s 39%.


Five years later, the BJP is a strong contender for the seat. It is banking on the wave of anti-incumbency against the ruling TMC government coupled with popular anger due to violence and intimidation during Panchayat elections (in a third of the seats, the TMC won uncontested, since opponents were not allowed to file nominations). A strategy of whipping up Hindu religious pride in a state where 27% people are Muslims also seems to be paying off as it has polarized voters sharply.


It looks like Balarampur town is painted in saffron. The mood is festive. Shops are covered with saffron flags with Jai Shree Ram or Jai Hanuman, the mythical monkey god, painted on them, and life-sized Hanuman idols greet visitors after entering the villages. The village is celebrating the last two days of Ram Navami, a biannual Hindu festival, with blaring music. A resident from Ruchup village explains that it is easier to plug a saffron flag on the bicycles or at the entrance to homes, than display a BJP party flag which may invite the ruling TMC’s wrath. Here, in the Panchayat elections last year, the BJP won several seats despite widespread violence and intimidation by TMC workers, he informs.


“After the elections, elected members were coerced to join the TMC. What they don’t understand is that they may have captured a few leaders but the public is not with them,"" says a young Swapan Pramanik. As the conversation ends he persuades his friends to put up a show of stick fights. Then he and his friends call a child for another show. The boy lifts his legs over the shoulders, and presses his palms together above his head in a namaste pose, holding a saffron flag and chanting Jai Shree Ram. The gathered youth pour out their complaints: rampant corruption, a perceived appeasement of Muslims, and grabbing Panchayats by force, etc.


It appears as if the upcoming elections are a referendum on the state government, and not one to elect a federal government. The performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not come up as a factor until asked explicitly by this reporter. “Balakot airstrike is not the poll issue... here anti-incumbency has overshadowed the Modi factor and people are likely to vote like assembly elections,"" says a senior journalist from Kolkata.


The BJP’s party office in Barra village in Purulia’s Raghunathpur is a tiny room which also doubles up as the meeting point of the local orchestra. It is here that Bhairav Karmakar recounts the ordeal of fellow party workers during the Panchayat elections in May last year. “There were uncountable false cases filed against us... during police raids in the night we used to swim across the river and take shelter in Jharkhand."" “We felt like biplobis (revolutionaries)... as if, this is another struggle for independence,"" Karmakar says with a burst of laughter.",0
"After testing in states such as Telangana and Karnataka, the company last month opened 500 Mi Stores across 470 villages in 14 states. “While the element of seasonality in sales is higher in rural areas, we saw that there is demand for even mid-premium devices in rural areas and there is a huge demand for TVs. Hence, we plan to grow this number to 5,000 Mi Stores by the end of 2019,"" Jain said.


The rural handset market has undergone a sea change with Reliance Jio last year introducing a cheap 4G handset JioPhone with a refundable deposit of ₹ 1,500 and later announcing cheap tariff plans offering free voice calls and unlimited data for as low as ₹ 49 a month.

"The ECI is stuck in the 1980s in the middle of a 2019 election. “Basically, they [ECI] are swatting flies in a cattle abattoir. They are not dealing with the carcass,"" Gupta added.


Crucially, all the current measures in place to regulate elections online are being implemented based on voluntary commitments made by four major platforms: Google, Facebook, Twitter, and ShareChat. “The rules with respect to platforms have not been improved beyond what they were in 2014,"" said Gupta. “So, there are no legally binding obligations on, for instance, Facebook or Twitter to take certain actions and there are no penalties prescribed for failing to do so.""


Further, the ECI has made no mention of regulating smaller platforms such as TikTok, Helo, Telegram, and WeChat, which are becoming increasingly relevant for political mobilization in rural and small-town India. And although Facebook has agreed to work with the ECI, none of the election-related initiatives announced by the company apply to its encrypted messenger service, WhatsApp, which is widely regarded as a hotbed of misinformation and hate speech.


The ECI has announced that the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), under whose leadership the four major platforms co-ordinated with the ECI to evolve and agree upon the new measures, is currently working on a code of ethics for internet platforms. “The initial group was formed to participate in the Sinha Committee [which was looking into Section 126 of the Representation of People Act]. No one declined to participate in either the committee proceedings or the making of [new] procedures,"" said Subho Ray, president of the IAMAI.


The new code of ethics, according to Ray, “will cover all Internet intermediaries"". However, he did not provide any indication as to whether these guidelines would be ready before the election and how the participation of other platforms would be ensured. “We have submitted a set of procedures. ECI is likely to come back to us with their feedback before we finalize,"" he added.


A person working within the frenetic political campaign of a south Indian party told Mint that the implementation of the new ECI guidelines has prompted their party to switch much of their communication to WhatsApp and the smaller platforms, where there are no restrictions. “So, instead of larger groups, we cater to smaller and more groups. There are an insane number of groups based on region, caste, etc. The reach is still good and the messaging is direct. There has been a good response for TikTok videos mocking other leaders as well.""


The person also indicated that in order to escape scrutiny on the larger platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, political parties are increasingly turning to alternative channels such as ad agencies, which push content on their behalf, as well as unofficial pages, and dummy accounts.


Facebook’s latest political advertising transparency report supports the claim that unofficial pages are ruling the roost. The two highest-spending pages so far, ""Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat"" and ""Nation with NaMo"", have spent a combined ₹2.77 crore on 4,669 ads since Facebook started tracking the data in February. In their disclosure documents, both pages have declared that they are based out of the BJP’s official headquarters in Delhi. Meanwhile, the BJP’s official page has spent just ₹8 lakh on 50 ads in the same period. Although Twitter and Google committed themselves to similar advertising transparency initiatives, they have not made the data available yet. Amit Malviya, the national information and technology in-charge of the BJP, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.",0

"It’s a world away from the scene a few years ago, when VR products from Samsung, Oculus, HTC and Sony seemed omnipresent and unstoppable at CES. These days, VR is mostly a niche product for gaming and business training, held back by expensive, clunky headsets, a paucity of interesting software and other technological shortcomings.


“VR hasn’t escaped the early adopter, gamer-oriented segment,"" said Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder — himself an early adopter who chafed in 2016 at delays in shipping Facebook’s then-groundbreaking Oculus Rift system. Gownder said many existing VR setups are still too hard to use; even simpler mobile systems like Samsung’s Gear VR, he said, don’t offer “a clear reason for the average non-gamer to get involved.""


VR proponents are still dreaming big, although the challenges remain formidable. Shipments of VR headsets rose 8% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, to 1.9 million units, according to data research firm International Data Corp. — an uptick that followed four consecutive quarters of decline . Nearly a quarter of a million units of Facebook’s Oculus Go and Xiaomi’s Mi VR — the same stand-alone VR headset, sold under different names in different markets — shipped worldwide in the quarter, IDC said.


Those still aren’t huge numbers for a technology that seemed to hold such promise in 2012 when early demonstrations of the Oculus Rift wowed audiences — so much that Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion two years later. Despite large sums ploughed into the field by Facebook, Sony, Samsung, Microsoft and Google, VR hasn’t yet made much of a dent in the real world.


Some of the biggest consumer complaints involve expense, laggy or glitchy graphics and the fact that many systems still tether the headsets to gaming consoles or PCs. “Technology is still what’s holding VR back,"" said eMarketer analyst Victoria Petrock. Upcoming stand-alone headsets like the Oculus Quest could solve some of those problems.",1

"The coming data revolution could lead to massive job losses and possible social unrest unless we start putting a price on user data.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Facebook Inc., and other tech giants offer us free internet services. And every time we use these services (in fact, Google tracks us even when we are not consciously using it), they collect data about us. From basic demographics to our secret desires, from our movements to our objects of hatred. It’s a boundless ocean of data about us that is fed to the artificial intelligence (AI) programs lurking behind these services. These are the most powerful surveillance machines the world has ever seen, which know a lot about what we are doing at any moment as long as we are carrying a smartphone.


Your data is crunched along with data from millions of other users so that the algorithms can learn and generate enormous profits for the companies. These are earned through what is still called “advertising"", but should possibly be called “behaviour manipulation"". Because Facebook not only knows to a great degree of precision whether you are the right person to be served a particular advertisement, but can also judge with some accuracy when should the ad appear on your wall, based on your past behaviour—maybe four seconds after you have “liked"" a cat video, or violently disagreed with someone on the Sabarimala issue.


Now, consider the AI revolution that is supposed to engulf our lives in the near future. Many professions are already facing extinction. But more than “artificial intelligence"", AI is “collective intelligence"".


AI algorithms are not created in a flash of inspiration by genius programmers. The process works thus: enormous amounts of human data is collected (Big Data), and through machine learning, algorithms are created to fit the data. As more and more data comes in, through adaptive feedback, the algorithms become more and more accurate.


It is the data—which we give away for free—that is the core of the vast profits of the world’s most valuable companies. Facebook, for example, pays only 1% of its value to its workers (programmers), because the rest of its work it gets free from us (Walmart pays 40% of its value in wages).


However, a few visionaries have been trying to introduce a radical new concept—“Data as Labour (DaL)""—that will make for a far more economically fair society in the digital age. The idea was first mooted by virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier in his 2013 book Who Owns The Future?


In other words, we should get paid for the data that we provide these companies because that is the real source of their profits. Hence, our online interactions are “work"". For instance, how would Google ever be able to direct us to our destinations without collecting data from the smartphones of millions of car drivers and passengers?",1

The party, according to local reports, has put forward offers for Thomas such as top positions in the apex organisational body All India Congress Committee (AICC) and convenor post in Congress-led alliance United Democratic Front, apart from an assembly ticket from Ernakulam later. But, so far, Thomas has been unwilling to accept any compensatory offers or even return to Kerala from Delhi in order to campaign for his replacement, sitting MLA Hibi Eden.


The drama unfolding has also in the backdrop years long factional feuds within Congress in Kerala. Eden belongs to what is known as the 'I' group within Congress, led by Chennithala, while Thomas has an image of a party man above group equations but has been closer to Chennithala's rival 'A' group, which is loyal to former chief minister Oommen Chandy. For Eden, incidentally, the development is also the wheel coming full turn. He was widely speculated to be a Lok Sabha candidate in 2009, when in a last minute twist, Congress chose Thomas as the candidate.


Thomas was criticised recently for lauding the BJP leader and prime minister Narendra Modi in a national conference of management experts in Kochi. Along with such episodes, the nature of the polls this time may have worked against him.",0

Open Society Foundations has also funded other groups that criticized Facebook, although the support wasn’t directed at the anti-Facebook activities, a foundation official said.


Definers, founded by Republican campaign veterans, was hired at a time that Facebook was scrambling to adjust to unexpected GOP power in Washington after it had benefited from years of chummy relationships with Democrats. In addition to its research activities into Facebook critics, Definers also worked to coordinate press coverage of events and announcements.


A Definers spokesman said the firm was ‘proud to have partnered with Facebook over the past year on a range of public affairs services’ and said that its memo on ‘the anti-Facebook organization’s potential funding sources was entirely factual and based on public records, including public statements by one of its organizers about receiving funding from Mr. Soros’ foundation.’

Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed power in May 2014, large swathes of India faced a drought which lasted for two years.

"According to an August 2018 report by research firm IDC, more than 70% of companies are using multiple cloud environments, and the largest data center challenge most companies face is developing a successful multi-cloud strategy.


To address this challenge, Dell also unveiled Dell Technologies Cloud - a set of cloud infrastructure solutions to make hybrid cloud (across public and private clouds and the edge, regardless of location) environments simpler to deploy and manage by combining the strengths of VMware and Dell EMC infrastructure. As Jeff Clarke, vice chairman of products and operations of Dell Technologies, put it: “Cloud is not a destination; it’s an operating model.""


Further, in a bid to help today's digital workforce be more productive, Dell Technologies also introduced its Unified Workspace solution, which uses data-driven insights to assess how employees are using their personal computers (PCs - desktops and laptops) — from the battery consumption and storage utilization to mobility requirements and most frequently-used applications — in a bid to help customers select the right PC and applications for each employee, and ship the devices pre-configured directly from the Dell factory.


All these announcements are building blocks of Dell's strategy to remain relevant to customers in today's digital world. The Dell Technologies family today includes Dell, Dell EMC, Pivotal, RSA, SecureWorks, Virtustream and VMware. When Dell first unveiled its blockbuster acquisition of EMC in 2015 for a whopping $67 billion, not everyone believed that he could pull it off.


As Dell himself put it during his keynote, ""Everyone needs to reimagine themselves in this digital age."" Even as Dell continues with the work of finding more synergies in his business units, the multi-cloud strategy is expected to pay good dividends. The reason: Enterprises are planning to move more workloads to the cloud as they work towards adopting a cloud-first strategy and implementing automated policies for governance.",1

When Xiaomi sub-brand POCO launched the POCO F1 last week, it focused on providing a more functional device to a very niche category of smartphone users – the enthusiasts. However, after a week of use, we have come to the conclusion that it can cater to people outside its target audience. Let’s find out why.


POCO has taken more of a utilitarian design approach for the F1. It skips the glass back to provide a more durable polycarbonate coating, which is practically crack and shatter proof. It also trades off a slimmer profile to accommodate a larger battery. It’s interesting to note that the phone has the same thickness as the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, but weighs less than it.


It securely fits in the hand and, thanks to the material, it doesn’t have the tendency to slip off. The buttons are well placed and will always be in reach.


The polycarbonate back has started wearing off a bit from the corners within a couple of weeks of use, which is my main area of concern with the choice of material.",1

Addressing a press conference at Undavalli (near Vijayawada), Naidu alleged that the Centre had even taken away Rs.350 crore after it gave the same for backward areas in AP. “The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) itself was part of passing the (bifurcation) bill.

"Helped by new product launches, US revenues of large pharma companies are expected to recover in FY20


The December quarter (Q3) results of Indian pharmaceutical companies, while unexciting, gave important cues about the US market.


One, companies are seeing reduced pricing pressure in the US generic drugs business, even though the degree varies across companies and product categories. Two, the long-awaited complex generics and specialty products businesses are finally shaping up. These segments have higher entry barriers and better price realizations. As these gain traction, and pricing pressure in the core generic drugs business subsides, chances of a rebound in US revenues in FY20 are quite high, say analysts.


“We expect US generic revenues to recover sharply over FY20-21 on the back of new launches, although the timing of the launches is still somewhat uncertain, which may push back the recovery in revenues and profits,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note referring to the domestic pharma companies.",3

Crude has surged nearly 30% this year on Saudi-led output cuts by the OPEC+ coalition that seeks to avert a global glut, and as American sanctions have also squeezed supplies from Venezuela and Iran. Meanwhile, a measure of oil volatility has risen 10% this week after Russia pressured the producer group to delay extending its curbs at a time when hopes are dimming over a trade deal between the US and China.

Theoretically you could charge your colleague’s iPhone by placing it on top of your S10 , but Samsung said it sees the feature mostly being used to charge accessories like headphones and smartwatches.


Samsung also takes the crown for offering the most storage for digital media. The S10 comes with up to a terabyte of internal capacity, which is double the 512GB maximum offered by the iPhone XS Max. But the S10 also supports microSD cards up to 512GB in capacity as well, meaning it’s possible to have triple the space compared to Apple’s flagship. (In fact, that 1.5TB total is higher than all but the most expensive of Apple’s MacBook Pro laptops.)


Until the phone gets released for review it’s impossible to say how well the S10 will perform compared to the iPhone. Apple’s device uses its own A12 Bionic chip, which has six processing cores, while Samsung uses an eight-core processor. But historically Apple’s custom-designed silicon, its integration with the iOS software it powers, together with the rest of the hardware in the phone, has given it the edge over competitors whose numbers, on paper, appear greate safer.

“The votes are going to be pro- or anti-Modi. The candidate does not feature in this,"" Ramjan Darga, a Kalaburagi-based political analyst said.


Darga said MPs who have served for two or more terms are asking for votes in the name of Modi, which raises questions about their individual performance and contributions. This is a disadvantage not felt by alliance candidates, several of whom are first-timers.",0

"The accessory highlights one of the key differences between the two products, and for some consumers is more important than a fraction of an inch of screen size or depth. The S Pen can be used for handwriting, annotation, and precise navigation around the Note’s interface. In Apple’s world, this is a luxury afforded only to iPad users for the time being.


Another important difference concerns “the notch."" At the top of the iPhone’s screen is a small cut-out that houses the front-facing camera and other sensors. Some Android-powered phones have followed this trend but the Note 9 hasn’t. Instead, Samsung’s screen is an uninterrupted rectangle.


However, the so-called notch did little to harm sales of the iPhone X, which was the first Apple product to include it, and it’s an aspect that now differentiates two of the largest phones on the market. Behind the glass, each device uses a variation of the same screen technology — OLED, rather than LCD — which produces high contrast images and deep black levels.


Apple and Samsung’s models both include two camera lenses to the rear — one wide-angle, one telephoto — which capture pictures at a resolution of 12 megapixels. The setup lets users take sharp pictures from greater distances, or create a blurred background effect, known as bokeh, which historically was a quality confined to professional cameras. Both companies will argue their respective software and image processing technologies will produce better results, but to the majority of users the differences will be too little to sway a purchase alone.


As smartphones have become our mobile wallets and airline boarding passes as well as products for communicating, biometric security has risen to become a major selling point. Samsung has continued to use fingerprint sensors along with options such as iris scanning and facial recognition to secure its devices. But Apple has gone all-in on its Face ID advanced facial-based authentication, and disposed of its Touch ID system and associated hardware button. The iPhone system presents a single solution to biometric security, and the technology has proven itself to be effective and accurate. Apple says the iPhone Xs Max will recognize faces faster that its previous products, which may be attractive to shoppers.",1

Last February was an example of a move that caught markets by surprise. The VIX stayed unusually low throughout 2017, lulling investors into a false sense of complacency. When volatility did pop during a meltdown -- the VIX skyrocketed to close 5 February at 37.32 — it left some short-volatility products broken beyond repair.


Potential triggers for price swings include factors like a worsening of global trade relations, a return to hikes by the Federal Reserve, an economic downturn or a geopolitical shock.

"Parliamentary candidates' expenditure is capped at up to 7 million Indian rupees (about $100,000), but the limit is widely flouted, and political parties are allowed to spend freely.


The New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies (CMS) estimates almost $8.6 billion will be spent on this year's vote, roughly twice the 2014 election.


The figure would surpass OpenSecrets.org's estimate that $6.5 billion was spent in the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections.


Recent reforms under Modi may have fueled the spending spree: Companies can fund parties anonymously through new 'electoral bonds' and they no longer face a donations cap. Activists say that gives corporations too much sway and obscures ties between politicians and businessmen.


About 95 percent of electoral bonds snapped up in a first tranche offering last year went to the BJP, according to data reviewed by Reuters through a Right To Information request and BJP filings.


When asked whether the BJP had a financial advantage, party spokesman Anil Baluni said ""it is not an unfair advantage.""


""I guess maybe the BJP does believe in taking maximum donations by cheque or through bonds... We are the largest political party in the country,"" Baluni added.


He said he did not have information on the provenance of funds or the uses. Pawan Khera, a Congress spokesman, said this was ""turning out to be the most unequal election,"" but did not provide specifics.

Researchers at Michigan State University recently unveiled a new facial-recognition software and app that can help protect endangered primates such as lemurs, golden monkeys and the chimpanzee.

The researchers first created a databank of pictures of these animals in the wild. They also created a corresponding Android app, PrimID. Neural networks and AI were an important part of this process. “Researchers in the field can now snap a photo of a golden monkey, drop it into the app and identify the primate in question with a high degree of confidence,"" according to an official press release.


The researchers believe the software and app can help in arresting the decline in the population of these animals that face a huge threat from illegal trade and trafficking. “If a captured great ape can be photographed and identified, knowing its origin can offer insights to its capture and help improve efforts to deter future crimes,"" the release adds.",1

Unless there is NRC, nobody would declare themselves as foreigner suo moto. So we are trying to evolve a formula where NRC has not been updated, the applicability of citizenship Bill will be restricted. We will try to find a way to give a bit relaxation for the hilly states of North-East where tribal culture exists. People should not see BJP as a party which does not respect the culture. So there will be some proposals from us to central government they should leave the applicability of the bill to the concerned state. If some state is very reluctant, so there will be some thinking, it will go on.


Rethink, not on the core but on certain issues like statistical disclosure, outer date. There may be rethinking on certain objects, not on the core. Core is the same that you have to give citizenship to minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh. I don’t think the BJP will have any rethinking on the core ideology of the bill.


That issue we have to now address. Till now we were concerned about NRC, now we have to see what you do with those people who are not identified, we have to seriously think on that. Immediately, I think, their status will not be disturbed except their names will be deleted from voter list.

"Even in the event that the ECI does eventually act, the question of whether merely taking content down is an effective deterrent. Since the MCC does not give the ECI any punitive powers, the only way it can take serious action against offenders is to file FIRs using provisions of other relevant laws such as the Representation of People Act or the Indian Penal Code. However, these cases rarely result in offenders being punished.


According to Sarvjeet Singh, executive director of the Center for Communication Governance at the National Law University Delhi, this status quo is largely due to the snail’s pace at which the judicial system works. “By the time cases are in their final stages, in most cases, the term of the MP or MLA is almost over..."" Gupta argues that the Constitution grants the ECI enough leeway to establish stronger regulations and that its current weak legal standing is down to a failure of imagination on its part.


Perhaps the hardest task in ECI’s unenviable list of responsibilities is that of ensuring that campaign-related activities cease 48 hours prior to polling. This silence period is intended to ensure that voters have a period of quiet reflection before casting their vote, free of last-minute manipulation.


Shivam believes that this rule has not accomplished much when implemented on the ground in the past. “Major rallies and events are stopped, but the last 48 hours is used for really clandestine things anyway. It’s not used for public meetings. It’s used for distribution of cash and liquor. It’s used to talk to village headmen who say that they have these many votes and getting them on your side. So, it really doesn’t matter that there are no speeches being made.""


On the internet, the task becomes doubly hard considering the volume of content and the diversity of sources.


According to Berges Malu, director of Public Policy, ShareChat, implementing this rule is simply not feasible. “Modi is the prime minister today. Say, he is fighting the election from Varanasi. Assume polling there is on a certain day. Assume 10 days before that is the election in Tamil Nadu and he says vanakkam to Tamil Nadu. Now, he is not contesting elections directly in that state. He is still PM. How am I supposed to stop him?""


Google will be implementing blocking at the state-level, sources said. The platform will stop serving political ads to users in that state 48 hours before any part of the state is going to polls. Facebook and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.


Although the measures taken by the ECI and the platforms to check the negative effects on the electoral process appear to be fraught with holes, they represent a start toward tackling a mammoth problem. “There is no way they will get it right in this election,"" said Sarvjeet. “But the fact that everyone is aware that there are issues and they have got at least the major platforms to agree to act, is a step forward.""",0

Typically, in the past, the BJP has tried to pin down the TMC on economic issues like jobs, industrial development (or the lack of it), and fiscal mismanagement. But, here’s the thing: despite a lack of visible development or a pervasive negative perception about the state, West Bengal is on par with most states on almost all critical parameters. The state for one has created some job opportunities; for example, close to 0.5 million people have found employment in the police force, as teachers and civil volunteers.


The Reserve Bank of India data on states shows that the state’s number of factories, on an average, grew by only 2-3% every year; yet, the same data shows that state’s manufacturing output has been growing quite handsomely. In fact, manufacturing’s share in gross state domestic product (GSDP) has been going up every year.


Even in terms of expenditure, analysis of Bengal’s budget data by PRS Legislative shows that the state’s spending on education, health and rural development, as a percentage of GSDP, has been higher than the average of 27 other states.


The BJP’s overarching rhetoric and narrative dominating this election cycle, though, is off-point and betrays a sense of desperation. The BJP has focused on leveraging the fear of the unknown, of the stranger, to gain additional vote share this time around. The conversation focuses on infiltration of Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, giving citizenship to Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, on citizenship issues and personal sleights against Mamata Banerjee. But she’s not one to give up, having been weaned on a brand of street-fighting politics that believed in giving it back in good measure. Lost amongst all this is any discussion of farm distress, jobs, capital investment by the government (centre and state) and the private sector.


This urgency is now being articulated through the instrument of violence, with all sides indulging in wanton violence against cadres and leaders of other parties. West Bengal politics has been characterized by electoral violence for over 50 years now with gang killings, territory control and attempts to marginalize political rivals eclipsing all other forms of political action.


The Congress and the CPM exercised power through an army of street thugs and lumpen proletariat who, over time, graduated to leadership positions within the party; and now the TMC is following the same template, having successfully acquired the CPM’s foot soldiers and political playbook.


The panchayat elections of May 2018 set new standards in political violence during the nomination filing and polling phases. The expectation of violence during this election cycle can be gauged from the fact that the Election Commission of India has staggered voting across all the seven phases in only two states—West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. This is purportedly to allow optimal deployment of central forces during each phase, which has been the BJP’s vocal demand for some time now.


One normally doesn’t associate the Bengali cultural ethos and sensitivity with violence; a state which gave birth to Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, Satyajit Ray and Amartya Sen is today a crucible for extreme political violence.",0

HYDERABAD: The Congress, which has lost nine of its 19 state legislators to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) since the December 2018 assembly elections, is on a decline in Telangana.


However, despite the setback, it is desperate to win at least a few parliamentary seats from the state, while the TRS aims to sweep all the 17 constituencies, barring the Hyderabad seat, a bastion of the All India Majilis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), with which it is on “friendly"" terms.",0
"Some more seat losses are expected elsewhere, though how much and from which state is up in the air. This makes West Bengal and the seven north-eastern states, with a total of 66 seats in the mix, critical for the saffron party, if it wishes to retain its position as the single largest party, which then the President can legitimately call upon to form the government.


The sharpest contrasts are in the sphere of economic policy. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee came to power on the back of protests against the previous CPM government’s forcible land acquisition from farmers on behalf of private investors and large corporates. This seemed to create an impression that she was anti-industry.


Jitendra Tiwari, Asansol mayor and a senior TMC functionary, defends the decision: “Look what happened to the Nano project after it shifted production to Gujarat. Its fortunes seem to vindicate Mamata Banerjee’s stand. She was not against giving land to industry; she was against forcible acquisition from farmers.""


After she became chief minister in 2011, Mamata Banerjee has been assiduously courting large corporates, both domestic as well as from overseas. She has been organizing investment summits featuring some of the largest Indian industrialists, including Mukesh Ambani.


So, here’s the confounding data point: the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises’ (MSMEs’) 2017-18 annual report shows that Bengal has the second largest number of MSME units in the country, with an estimated 8.86 million units accounting for 14% of the national share. Uttar Pradesh holds the top slot, with a marginally higher 8.99 million units. Tamil Nadu (4.94 million units) and Maharashtra (4.77 million units) are at third and fourth spots, respectively.


Evidently, there has been a profusion of MSME in the state, even though large corporates are yet to commit capital for large manufacturing projects (with the exception of IT majors Infosys, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services).


It also defies the commonly-held principle that small-scale units usually thrive under the benign shadow of large industry.


According to a Kolkata-based entrepreneur, there is a definite strategy at play here: Mamata Banerjee deliberately showcases large industry at investment summits in the full knowledge that they will take time to loosen their purse strings but that their high-profile presence and likelihood of a future investment motivates and emboldens small-scale entrepreneurs.


There is, of course, a lot of support from the state government in the form of incentives and concessions. In addition, many young graduates are being encouraged to put up tiny units. A young motorcycle-borne graduate, participating in the road-show organized for former railway minister and the TMC’s Barrackpore candidate Dinesh Trivedi’s campaign, makes paper cups and seems to be satisfied with the business prospects; another has acquired a few buses which run on commercial passenger routes (Kolkata allows private operators to run city bus services, alongside the government-owned service).",0

"“We are not going to take any of the rhetoric this time. We need a good candidate who will help us in the true sense. We don’t want big promises,"" asserts an angry Rambhai in Sagra.


Keshubhai, Hardasbhai and Rambhai are representative voices of almost the entire Saurashtra region. Just change their names and that of their villages and the same complaints reverberate across the belt.


There’s also the omnipresent Hardik Patel factor. This time, Hardik Patel is firmly in the Congress camp. The firebrand youth leader’s massive agitation for reservations to the Patidar (or Patel) community made a huge impact in Saurashtra, which has a sizeable population of the Patidar community. There are three Lok Sabha seats (out of the seven in this region) entirely dominated by the Patidars (or Patels), and the Congress won a majority of the assembly seats that fall within those three parliamentary seats in 2017.


The stream of defections from these assembly segments has propped up the ruling party’s hopes, however. An influential leader from the Ahir community and son of a Congress veteran, Jawahar Chavda, who was inducted into the BJP government as a minister, has been a four-time MLA from Manavadar. His Manavadar constituency falls under Porbandar Lok Sabha seat, though it is in the neighbouring Junagadh district. His joining the BJP is significant in view of the fact that the ruling party had lost all seven assembly seats under Junagadh in 2017.


Similarly, the BJP could manage to win only two assembly seats while the Congress walked away with the remaining five under the Amreli Lok Sabha seat. Here, significantly, Ahir leader Kanubhai Kalsaria, a former three-time BJP MLA from Mahuva, has recently joined the Congress. Amreli has a huge Patidar population and is a rural region with farmers in severe distress. Congress candidate for the seat, Paresh Dhanani, a Patidar, who is also the leader of opposition in the state assembly, is a force to reckon with, making it an uphill task for the BJP to win the seat.


The upshot of this frenzy of defections in a landscape of rural angst and urban nationalism is this: the state may throw up a split verdict, though the BJP still clearly holds the edge. Large sections of Modi’s home state still find it hard to look past the man who has been on a steady ascent since 2002. But the era of clean sweeps at the polls may be coming to a close.


In many ways, Gujarat has not moved on from 2017 despite having a new government in the state for well over a year. The urban-rural divide is still unmistakable and omnipresent. The ruling BJP’s formula to bridge this divide seems to be its shrill time-tested Modi versus Congress-Pakistan-anti-development rhetoric. The Congress, meanwhile, has been making a strong pro-farmer, pro-poor, anti-crony capitalism pitch. Irrespective of which of those two turn out to be the winning narrative, the story from Saurashtra and Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati may be entirely different.",0
"There was a bloodbath on the stock as investors punted the Yes Bank counter, which plunged close to 30 percent to ₹168 on the BSE after hitting a low of ₹165.30 against a flat closing of the benchmark. (Reuters)

"THIRD, consideration should also be given to the possibility of individual pensions instead of, or along with, household pensions. As things stand, NYAY is taken to involve household pensions of ₹6,000 per month. This works out to ₹1,200 per month in per-capita terms, on average, assuming a household size of five. As an initial benchmark, individual pensions could be pegged at ₹1,200 per month. With the same budget, NYAY could cover 50 million household pensions of ₹6,000 per month, or 250 million individual pensions of ₹1,200 per month, or any other combination of household and individual pensions that covers about 20% of the population. This would help to depart from the rigidity of the 6x20 formula.


FOURTH, the first call on individual NYAY pensions should go to the elderly, widows and disabled persons. These individuals tend to live very deprived lives, not just among poor households. India already has a pension scheme for them, the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). As mentioned earlier, however, the central government contribution to NSAP pensions is abysmally low. Many states supplement this from their own funds, but even the supplement-inclusive amounts are small.


Moreover, NSAP covers only 33 million pensioners—barely one fourth of the reference group. Under NYAY, social security pensions for the elderly, widows and disabled persons could be universalized at an enhanced rate of ₹1,200 per month, plus state supplements. Better perhaps, the coverage could be “quasi-universal"": universal subject to well-defined exclusion criteria. NSAP has a good record, this is largely a matter of expanding the scheme.


FIFTH, on a similar note, NYAY could cover enhanced maternity benefits of ₹1,200 per month for six months, or even 12 months, for all pregnant women (except those already receiving maternity benefits in the formal sector). One possible concern is that this might hamper the drive towards lower fertility rates. But fertility rates are declining steadily, and India is now very close to the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.


A minor reduction in the rate of fertility decline, if it happens at all, is perhaps not a major issue, compared with the need to protect the well-being of mothers and children. States like Tamil Nadu are already giving maternity benefits larger than what is being proposed here, and no spike in fertility has been reported there.


SIXTH, NYAY should also provide for automatic inclusion of some highly vulnerable groups such as particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), nomadic tribes and manual scavengers. These groups are already identified to a large extent, in the population census or elsewhere. Jharkhand already has a pension scheme for all PVTGs, which seems to help them a lot. The rehabilitation of manual scavengers is an unresolved challenge that has haunted India for decades. NYAY may be the chance to cross that bridge.


SEVENTH, a reasonable proportion of NYAY pensions could be allocated at the discretion of gram panchayats and gram sabhas. Centralized identification of poor households is bound to involve substantial exclusion errors. Further, the economic status of a household varies over time, and it is difficult for centralized databases to keep up. Community identification, of course, raises its own problems, including the possibility of corruption and conflict. Leaving the allocation of all or most NYAY pensions to the discretion of gram panchayats and gram sabhas would probably be a mistake. However, there is a case for their having discretion over at least a small share of NYAY pensions, to reduce exclusion errors.


EIGHTH, NYAY pensions should be heavily concentrated in rural areas. The reason is that living conditions and economic insecurity are generally much worse in rural areas than urban areas. This is not always evident from, say, National Sample Survey (NSS) data on per-capita expenditure. Indeed, according to some NSS-based poverty estimates, urban poverty is as high as rural poverty in many states.",0

"Rallis India derives a fifth of its revenues from exports. So, a recovery in the global agrochemical market should benefit the company as well. However, much of its fortunes are intertwined with the Indian market, where tepid demand pushed up inventories and clouded the outlook for future sales.


The sharp rise in raw material costs is compounding the problem for local agrochemical sellers. Plant shutdowns related to pollution curbs in China crimped raw material supplies and drove up prices.


Export-oriented companies have withstood the pressure relatively better, because of greater backward integration. However, a strengthening rupee can negate this advantage to some extent, putting the onus on price hikes. How well the companies navigate this will be crucial. Besides, valuations of UPL and PI Industries, at 18 times and 34 times estimated FY20 estimates, respectively, are not cheap to own.",3
"In an election rally in November, when Modi said that “ (the) Congress worships cow in Madhya Pradesh but Kerala leaders eat beef in public"", one man challenged: “I am from Kerala, I have many friends belongs (sic) to BJP and RSS all of them eats beef."" This became the top comment. On claims that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in Bengal had created around 900,000 jobs in the last fiscal year, the top comment, with over a thousand likes, read: “I am from bengal and all these figures are fabricated.. Whoever joins in TMC, she counts it as a new job.""

This dude doesn’t know anything.""


Some users go far enough to write a blog-style comment. Responding to Modi’s statement critiquing Jawaharlal Nehru for his ignorance about farmer woes, a user wrote a 500-word comment arguing how “India has grown tremendously"" in the last 60 years, crediting “brilliant decisions"" by “all ex-Prime Ministers"", which has made India the “second biggest power in Asia"". He listed 19 bullet points to further his claim, ending with a request to not “make Modi a God"". The comment fetched more than 1,800 likes—and stays at the top of the comment thread.


Critics often complain that the mainstream media is not inclusive enough. Take Jammu and Kashmir. In the jingoistic narratives about the past, present and the future of the disputed territory, the stakeholders—native Kashmiris—are often missing. The Facebook comment section breaks that. Following Pulwama, when migrants from the valley were mercilessly attacked across the country, one Kashmiri openly declared, “this is the main reason we Kashmiris want to freedom from India"", a local sentiment that sounds uncomfortable, and rarely seen, in the mainstream. Unless page moderators decide to delete or hide a comment, it’s only Facebook’s algorithm that pushes the comment to the top. Inaccurate information sometimes passes that filter.


On a news article shared through The Indian Express’s Facebook page, about Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s statement that “nations cannot be held responsible for the dastardly acts of terrorists""—referring to the Pulwama attack—the top comment is blatantly false. “He has got millions of dollar in his foreign account from Pakistan Army. He is now the spokesperson of Pakistan Army to India,"" the top comment with over two hundred likes, read. “Arrest him n put on jail for 5 years, then he’ll learn better skill of politics,"" the user suggested.


People have fun, too. In March, when Congress president Rahul Gandhi remarked that he will give all the money belonging to businessman to the public if he “gets hold"" of diamantaire Nirav Modi, one user said: “Should make MOVIE on rahul gandhi and movie should name- “GAANJAA"" - THE ULTIMATE POWER.""


The activity in the comment space varies significantly by language. The English media comment feed is relatively more liberal than vernacular pages. For example, a larger number of top comments on English pages called for Indo-Pak peace post-Pulwama as compared to Hindi media pages. The latter also show much higher support for Modi and the BJP, with relatively little critique about government as compared to its English counterparts.


Top comments in the Hindi media pages are more creative, with jokes and shayari featuring on the top. The “most relevant"" comments on the live broadcasts of Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi’s rallies have got nothing to with the context of the post. It’s mostly Modi fandom: “mohabat ho gayee hai Modi tere naam se, deevaane ho gaye hai Modi tere kaam se, vote kya cheez hai jaan bhi de denge , Modi tere lie shaan se!"" (Modi, I am in love with your name. Modi, I am a fan of your work. Votes are nothing, Modi, I will proudly give my life for you.)


This comment, like many other carefully crafted messages that are appealing enough to catch attention, was repeated across multiple posts, hinting that non-original vernacular content is lifted from a repository to drive engagement on political posts.",0

"Memory chips account for the biggest portion of Samsung’s profit. Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules fell about 5% in the December quarter, according to InSpectrum Tech Inc. Prices for 128 gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips fell about 3.4%.


Apple’s surprise cut to its sales forecast last week suggested a worsening outlook for orders. Apple receives memory chips and smartphone screens from Samsung and is the South Korean manufacturer’s biggest customer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.


Samsung said it expects earnings to remain subdued in the first three months of the year due to difficult conditions for memory. Profitability will recover in the second half, the company predicted, on projected improvements in the market, with rising adoption of new CPUs and launches of new smartphone products.


While Samsung still leads the world in smartphone sales, it’s being squeezed by Chinese handset makers like Huawei Technologies Co.

That means consumers are using a smart TV with a Netflix app or plugging in a set-top-box running the Netflix app to get their 'Stranger Things' fix. Only 10% of users watch Netflix on phones, while PCs get 15% and tablets 5%, according to the data.


Netflix has a booming business outside the US, so if it can only get 10% of viewers from Android, then Apple likely decided it was worth the risk to ignore that distribution channel.


Still, Apple’s push into more digital services is forcing the company to embrace other devices. Apple already offers iTunes and iCloud storage applications for PCs.

"In the software department, the Redmi 7 is a trademark Xiaomi device running the company's proprietary user interface, MIUI 10. It runs on top of Android 9 out-of-the-box. It feels slightly more polished than Samsung's new custom UI, running on the M10.


A weak link in Xiaomi phones is the camera. While Xiaomi has addressed that with the Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Redmi 7 feels like a chip off the old block. It has a 12-MP camera for regular shots and a 2MP depth camera for bokeh shots. While portrait shots look good, regular landscape shots lack clarity and even colours look washed out.

Redmi 7 has an edge over the Galaxy M10 in terms of display, UI and design. The Realme 3 on the other hand is on par with it in terms of looks with its dual tone finish, battery backup, and overall performance. However, its custom UI is quite bland compared to MIUI 10.

"Possibly the biggest feature from WhatsApp this year, stickers were also one of the top searched things on Google.


While what it does is very simple, it’s very vibrant and dynamic in doing so. Other instant messaging platforms have had this feature for quite a while, but WhatsApp made it available only recently, in October.


You can find WhatsApp stickers in an icon right next to the emoji and GIF icons in the emoji menu. You are then greeted with three tabs—one with your recent stickers, second with your favourites and the third containing all the stickers. There’s also a “plus"" icon in the corner that allows you to add more stickers to WhatsApp via a sticker store.


This might require some amount of experience with Adobe Photoshop and basic image editing. The stickers need to have a resolution of exactly 512x512 pixels and should have a file size of less than 100kb. We are sure once you get the hang of it, you’ll be making memes in no time.


Data privacy has become a major concern mainly after some major tech companies were shown to compromise user data without their consent.

""With the proliferation of smartphones, gaming as a concept has picked up in India and the market is also ready now for PC gaming,"" Vickram Bedi, Senior Director-Personal Systems, HP Inc India, told IANS.


Micro-blogging site Twitter recently revealed that it recorded one billion tweets on games with role-playing mobile game ""Fate/Grand Order"" topping the charts, closely followed by Fortnite and PUBG.


With the kind of loyalty towards games in terms of increased user-base, reach and time invested that has been noted in recent years, it would not be wrong to say that from just being a mode of recreation, group mobile gaming has risen to become a new dimension of existence for the millenials in India, say experts.",1
"Cozying up to the president to spare Apple products from tariffs also risks angering Apple’s employees in liberal Silicon Valley — even some of its customers. So far, Cook has walked a fine line, holding cordial private meetings with Trump while also publicly criticizing his policies, without drawing the ire of the president or Apple employees.


On Friday, speaking to reporters at the White House Rose Garden, Trump reiterated that he wanted Apple to move manufacturing to the United States.


“Don’t forget that Apple makes their product in China,"" he said. “I told Tim Cook, who is a friend of mine and who I like a lot, ‘Make your product in the United States. Build those big, beautiful plants that go on for miles it seems. Build those plants in the United States.’""


He went to say that China, not the United States, gets the biggest benefit from Apple. “They build their product mostly in China.""


Two months ago, Cook slipped a wonky announcement into Apple’s earnings call: The company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, Macs and iPads it sold. “The number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business,"" he reasoned.


Apple had reported the metric for years, highlighting tremendous growth in iPhone sales. But those sales have leveled off over the past two quarters. In an earnings call at the end of January, Cook will probably tell investors that the iPhone business is slowing. How much? That will be up to people outside the company to figure out.


Investors were displeased — even before the surprise news about sales in China. Apple shares have since dropped more than 30%, shaving $380 billion off its market value. The most valuable public company in the world not long ago is now worth less than long-time rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, Google’s parent company.",1
"Unravel your IT stack: By taking a modular approach and decoupling infrastructure, data, architecture and applications, you can remove unnecessary dependencies across all layers of the solution stack. The idea is to build a series of modular components that can be continually reassembled to meet business needs as they arise. The importance of this step can’t be overstated: It frees value locked in legacy systems and provides a critical bridge between core and new digital systems, thereby enabling innovation at scale. For a true boundary-less system, you will need to decouple data and applications, applications from legacy systems, and all tightly integrated systems.


The boundary-less systems emerging today enable a level of agility and dynamism that’s truly breath-taking. The monolithic IT stacks of the past are being replaced by endlessly reconfigurable modules that are seemingly limitless as they emerge, underpin new partnerships and find new business models.


As these become obsolete, the modules are broken down and reused elsewhere. To my mind, boundary-less systems are the single best solution yet to our age of disruption and, one that I believe, the business leaders tomorrow will be built on.",1

"To answer that, think first of a sight I’m sure you’ve seen often: Sparks flying when a piece of metal drags along the ground, or rubs against another piece of metal. Maybe it’s an old car with some piece of its chassis loose and scraping the road surface as the car speeds past. Maybe it’s the wheels of a train against the rails it rides on, as it picks up speed.


Why do we see those sparks? You think “friction"" and you’re right, but that’s only a partial explanation. That is, it’s not just friction that’s the cause. For example, you wouldn’t see such sparks if the car dragged a rod made of plastic or wood along the ground. There is certainly friction, and it might wear away the rod, but you don’t see any sparks. Try a palm frond, or a tablecloth, or a newspaper, or the pretty stilettos Poorna aunty gave you. No sparks from any of those. A glass bottle? It will simply shatter, and right away.


For sparks to appear, the substance that’s dragged along the ground needs to be “pyrophoric"", a word whose Greek root means “fire-bearing"". A pyrophoric material is prone to spontaneous ignition under certain conditions, without necessarily being heated to high temperatures. Many relatively obscure substances have this property and must therefore be handled with some care. But some familiar substances are also pyrophoric: Aluminium and iron, for example.


I’m guessing you read that last sentence and your brow wrinkled. You are wondering why your aluminium thali, or your house keys and the always rusting keyrings, have never spontaneously caught fire. The point here is my mention above of “under certain conditions"". Those conditions are met when objects made of these metals are subjected to friction, like with the surface of a road. What happens then is that the friction chips away tiny pieces of the metal, and these pieces spontaneously ignite as they fly through the air, and voilà: The shower of sparks that you’ve seen plenty of times.


This is the mechanism at work in more common cigarette lighters, or in now obsolete guns known as “flintlocks"". In the guns, for example, a small and sharp piece of hard stone called flint is held cocked in position. When the trigger is pulled, it rapidly rotates forward and strikes a piece of steel. The friction between flint and steel shears off small shards from the steel. They ignite, and that shower of sparks is directed into a little pan filled with gunpowder. In turn, the gunpowder ignites and…well, you get the picture: The gun fires. With the cigarette lighter, it’s much the same. When your thumb turns that minuscule wheel, it rubs against a piece of metal and scrapes off tiny pieces that catch fire. At the same time, you’re releasing some of the fuel from inside the lighter and…well, you get the picture again: You have a flame. (Not that I’m suggesting that you smoke.)


So, if you now have an idea of how those sparks you see so often are formed, what is the connection to helicopters, and to military ones at that?",1

You’re right. Actually, most of the things we see in a smartphone have reached the saturation level in one way or the other. If you see the screens, we now have phones that are reaching nearly 100% screen-to-body ratio. So, what can be the new valuation or innovations in displays? Maybe foldable screens, right?

The brag-worthy specs do not end here. Completing the “Very 2018"" look of the smartphone is a mechanical slider that houses the camera. Unsurprisingly, the smartphone is aimed at gamers.


The smartphone was launched alongside the Lenovo Z5s, the successor to the company’s mid-range torchbearer Lenovo Z5.

The platform has over 60,000 stolen digital identities that can be used to carry out online or credit card transactions without the knowledge of the real user, according to a Kaspersky Labs note released on Monday.


Digital masks are a machine learning-based anti-fraud solution used by financial institutions to verify if it is the actual user who is trying to make another transaction or a hacker who has acquired the payment details illegally. It remembers fingerprints of devices and browsers, used for payments, and then uses AI to match them with the browser cookies, and online and computer behaviour of a new transaction.


Anyone with a stolen digital mask and the login credentials of a user can use these to make online payments using a proxy connection without raising any suspicion.

Tim Cook is hitting what could be the toughest time of his tenure in Apple's corner office, and his legacy as heir to Steve Jobs will be on the line. Here are five reasons


Apple IncTim CookApple sharesApple Qualcomm caseUS China trade relationsChina trade warApple China baniPhone ban


Do not pity Timothy D. Cook. He has made hundreds of millions of dollars as Apple’s chief executive. He is regarded as one of business’ best bosses, and he runs a company with a beloved brand and $130 billion in cash.


Even so, he is hitting what could be the toughest time of his tenure in Apple’s corner office, and his legacy as heir to Steve Jobs will be on the line. Here are five reasons:


The signature innovation of Apple’s late co-founder, Jobs, was the iPhone. Cook’s has been his ability to crack the Chinese market. That strategy delivered hundreds of millions of new customers and helped make Apple the first private company to surpass $1 trillion in market value by August last year.


But now it might be backfiring. The Chinese economy is sputtering and the trade war between the United States and China isn’t getting much better. With most adults — even children — in the developed world now owning one if not two smartphones, Apple has relied on China to keep growing.",1

We see significant investment from big tech firms focused on horizontal AI platforms and start-ups focused on niche domain solutions. A critical constraint is the availability of large sets of good quality data that can be used to learn AI algorithms. While ‘point AI solutions’ are flourishing, we see a clear trend towards enterprises adopting a ‘general AI’ approach that unifies their efforts across their business functions. As China and the US fight for AI supremacy, India has the potential to become an AI powerhouse given the large talent base and access to consumers willing to try new AI enabled products and services.


As billions of devices, services and systems get connected, we see consumers benefiting from improved lifestyle use cases and companies becoming more efficient as they minimize operational costs and increase asset utilization.A key enabler will be the advent of 5G technology that will improve the performance and security of IoT platforms.


3D printing is moving to industrial scale in a number of industries such as aerospace and defence, automobile, medical and engineering.

As the battle for women's votes heats up, Modi has pointed to programmes to provide toilets and subsidised cooking gas cylinders as evidence his administration cares for women. This month, the main opposition party, Congress, vowed to reserve a third of federal government jobs for women if elected.


""We do not find too many women in the segment we service, even though we would like to hire more women because they are more sincere, there is less attrition and they can multi-task,"" said Vineet Pandey, who owns Mumbai-based housekeeping firms Kaarya Facilities & Services and Hecqo.com.

One businessman who employees roughly 1,000 men at his chemical factory in southern India, says hiring women would mean providing separate bathrooms and transport at night.


He argues bypassing men would also stoke tensions in India, where economic transformations and an influx of technology are testing the social fabric.


""In the rural areas, it is a more patriarchal society, if we give jobs to women and not men, there will be complaints from men,"" said the businessman, who asked to remain anonymous.

"Naturally, Huawei denies any manipulation of the cable sets it is constructing, even though the US and other nations say it is obligated by Chinese law to hand over network data to the government. The US last year restricted federal agencies using from using its 5G equipment; Huawei responded with a lawsuit in federal court. Washington is pressuring its allies to follow its lead — the American ambassador to Germany warned that allowing Chinese companies into its 5G project would mean reduced security cooperation from the US — but this is an uphill battle. Most nations and companies feel that better cell phone service is worth the security risks.


A similar dynamic is playing out underwater. How can the US address the security of undersea cables? There is no way to stop Huawei from building them, or to keep private owners from contracting with Chinese firms on modernizing them, based purely on suspicions. Rather, the US must use its cyber- and intelligence-gathering capability to gather hard evidence of back doors and other security risks. This will be challenging — the Chinese firms are technologically sophisticated and entwined with a virtual police state.


And back doors aren’t the only problem: Press reports indicate that US and Chinese (and Russian) submarines may have the ability to “tap"" the cables externally.

"Insults clearly increase traction and politicians instinctively know it. On average, a tweet that includes an insult is significantly more likely to be retweeted, with retweet rates ranging from 32-101% higher than a normal tweet. Congress president Rahul Gandhi has become a master of the insult genre and his political makeover is closely tied in with an ability to insult effectively, which, data shows, began in earnest in the final months of 2017. Wielding insults is also a weapon of the opposition, as Akhilesh Yadav’s transformation shows once he stopped being the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.


The Indian political landscape, of course, has a long history when it comes to insults. During her early political career, former prime minister Indira Gandhi was dismissed as a “goongi gudiya"" (dumb doll). Modi once called Sonia Gandhi a “Jersey cow"". And Modi himself has been called everything from a thief to a merchant of death. But perhaps no other insult campaign has been as sustained and as politically effective as the pejorative nickname for Rahul Gandhi—“Pappu"" (an immature person).


During much of the 2014 general election campaign, the Congress thought that social media wasn’t worth engaging in. Meanwhile, the cult of “pappu"" was built into a powerful meme. Starting in 2013, even banal criticism of Modi would invite a furious backlash online but “pappu"" jokes could be freely shared. However, things began to change in 2017. First, the “Office of Rahul Gandhi"" came online. Then, after a short spell of benign tweeting, around the middle of 2017, Rahul discovered a new, edgy side (see chart 1). His tweets started to get noticed and retweeted aggressively (see chart 2).


Rahul Gandhi discovered an edgy, new side in late-2017. In the months since, nearly half of his tweets have included insulting or confrontational language.


The increasing trraction Rahul Gandhi began to receive since early 2018 uncannily overlaps with the period during which he began to insult more.


In India, one can never go after demigods, and Modi astutely never allowed Rahul to become one, despite the attempted political makeover. If not “pappu"", he was a “shehzada"" (a princeling). The insult campaign against Rahul has been BJP’s biggest branding victory.


However, in terms of online visibility at least, Rahul began to turn the conversation around by early 2018. Among a subset of 4,931 known politicians active on Twitter, belonging to both the BJP and the Congress, the Congress began to consistently talk about Rahul more than they were talking about Modi. More importantly, Rahul went from being mentioned by less than 10% of BJP politicians to consistently finding space in over half of the ruling politicians’ tweets.

NEW DELHI: Data theft has emerged as one of the biggest concerns as cybercriminals are increasingly going after more critical data for greater leverage over companies. In September 2018, personal information including credit card details of 380,000 passengers of British Airways was reportedly stolen. A cyber attack on Singapore’s largest healthcare institution, SingHealth, in July 2018, compromised non-medical details of 1.5 million patients, including the country’s Prime Minister.


According to McAfee’s data exfiltration report, called Grand Theft Data II – The Drivers and Shifting State of Data Breaches, published today, 43% of the participants were greatly concerned about theft of personally identifiable information and intellectual property. On the other hand, 30% found theft of payment card details more distressing, even though the report claims that payment card is not a big target because of new payment technologies and improved fraud detection systems. The concern over the personally identifiable information is higher in Europe due to the roll out of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, which mandates heavy penalty on companies for failure to communicate data breaches to users. Theft of intellectual property is a bigger concern in the Asia-Pacific region.",1

"Smart speakers are among the fastest growing categories of consumer electronics, led by Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home devices. (Bloomberg)


After you connect a light fixture to Alexa, Amazon wants to know every time the light is turned on or off


Amazon and Google are expanding the amount of data they gather about customers who use voice software to control gadgets


SEATTLE: As Amazon.com Inc. and Google work to place their smart speakers at the center of the internet-connected home, both technology giants are expanding the amount of data they gather about customers who use their voice software to control other gadgets.


For several years, Amazon and Google have collected data every time someone used a smart speaker to turn on a light or lock a door. Now they’re asking smart-home gadget makers such as Logitech and Hunter Fan Co. to send a continuous stream of information.


In other words, after you connect a light fixture to Alexa, Amazon wants to know every time the light is turned on or off, regardless of whether you asked Alexa to toggle the switch. Televisions must report the channel they’re set to. Smart locks must keep the company apprised whether or not the front door bolt is engaged.


This information may seem mundane compared with smartphone geolocation software that follows you around or the trove of personal data Facebook Inc. vacuums up based on your activity. But even gadgets as simple as light bulbs could enable tech companies to fill in blanks about their customers and use the data for marketing purposes. Having already amassed a digital record of activity in public spaces, critics say, tech companies are now bent on establishing a beachhead in the home.",1
"The Congress party, on the other hand, expects the rise of a Hindu vote bank to benefit it more than the BJP.

Some analysts agree. “The high voter turnout in politically important and minority-dominated constituencies suggests the BJP elbowing for power has only benefitted the BJP and Congress,"" said Jacob George, an analyst. “The question is who will benefit most from the anti-BJP votes.""


The BJP remains hopeful. “A significant surge in vote shares for the BJP, proving a split of Kerala’s bipolar vote banks to create a third Hindu vote bank, could bring a tectonic shift in the state politics. Unlike in other states, it has only taken a small slide in vote shares for the communists and the Congress to win or lose seats in Kerala,"" said a BJP leader, requesting not to be named.",0

According to a April 2018 report by Counterpoint Research, the shipments of 5G smartphones is expected to grow 255% by 2021, reaching 110 million units.

"A close affinity prevails between cultural attitudes to beef eating and political affiliation. Almost 90% of the Hindu youth supporters of Left parties did not disapprove of eating beef. Disapproval of beef consumption was the highest among the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters and found moderate support among the youth supporters of regional parties.


There are other layers in the social picture. The idea of inter-caste marriage, according to the CSDS-KAS survey, found greater acceptance among the married respondents, even as the bulk of them had married within their own caste. Further, about a half of the unmarried youth preferred an arranged marriage and only around a tenth among them wish for “a love marriage"". And, in a clear illustration of the economic distress of rural India, the number of unmarried youth in rural areas is rising sharply when compared with that in cities.


Regional cultures offer a space of belonging in the lives of youth. While many millennials strongly identify as Indians, regional identities also have a strong appeal to them. A close embrace of regional identities—the Malayalees, the Assamese and the Gujaratis, among others—is likely to matter in the scheme of their political priorities. The Kannadiga millennial might not have taken to the streets over the use of Hindi language in metro stations in Bengaluru last year. Yet, she vigorously supports the Kannada cause on social media platforms, assists in the development of free software to help non-Kannadigas learn Kannada and helps build internet content in Kannada.


It appears that the millennials share more with the older generations inside their states than with their peers elsewhere in India. For instance, in states where the older voters prefer regional parties, the youth too supported these parties. Indeed, the support for regional parties among the youth matches that for the BJP and far exceeded that for the Congress.


Inside the states, political culture shifts between urban and rural areas. In rural India, where ties of clan and caste tend to be strong, familial inheritance of political power is more likely to seem acceptable than in urban India. Whereas the countryside demands adequate farm prices and affordable education and healthcare, urban India tends to obsess more over the quality of physical infrastructure. A healthy diet, clean air and respect for animal rights, which are among the values shaping the moral imagination of the urban middle-class youth, hardly resonate as political issues in rural India.


The urban and rural locations of the millennials, therefore, translate into a marked difference in their political values.


The urban-rural divide parallels the linguistic divide between English and Indian languages. The recent remarks of the head of the Karnataka BJP social media unit, Balaji Srinivas, disclose an awareness of this detail: “We have concentrated on generating content in Kannada this time around—95% of our content will be in Kannada. The remaining 5% will be in English to cater to the urban audience.""",0

"As a traditional haven in times of turmoil, bullion is seeing a resurgence of demand after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that interest-rate increases could be off the table for now. Signs of a global slowdown and the prolonged U.S.-China trade war have added uncertainty to financial markets. With sentiment toward gold brightening since mid-October, it finished last year with its best quarter since March 2017 as stock-market volatility and a partial U.S. government shutdown also spurred demand.


Sofaz, whose holdings now exceed 80 percent of Azerbaijan’s gross domestic product, was established in 1999 to manage oil and natural-gas income of the third-largest crude producer in the former Soviet Union. The fund expects its assets to rise by $2.3 billion and hit a record high of $40 billion this year, Movsumov said.


In 2012, Sofaz started to diversify by adding gold, equities and real estate. While the regulations allowed the fund to invest as much as 25 percent of its holdings in equities last year, it opted to keep those investments as low as 13 percent to 14 percent.


“We decided that it was not the right time to increase investment in equities, and we were right,"" Movsumov said. “As life showed, last year was a very bad year for equities.""",3
"Weak auto demand, especially in Europe due to WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Testing Procedure) and a strike at carmaker Audi’s plant, dragged revenue down. This, along with costs of ramping up operations, weighed on SMP’s profits.


Only its Finnish subsidiary PKC fared well during Q3. While most of Motherson Sumi’s subsidiaries have higher exposure to the retail auto segment, namely cars and bikes, PKC has a huge client base of heavy-duty trucks, especially in North America and China. It posted a 230 basis points year-on-year jump in Ebitda margin to 8.6%, driven by revenue growth.


Motherson Sumi’s standalone operations however failed to impress. Revenue declined 3% year-on-year. A robust 16% jump in exports partly offset a 6% decline in domestic revenue. Here too, weak sales impacted Ebitda margin that narrowed by 120 basis points to 14.9%.


In other words, size is weighing on the behemoth’s profit margin. Analysts believe that the auto parts maker will face headwinds in the quarters ahead on account of a global auto slowdown, a steep fall in US Class 8 truck sales and technology transition.",3

In Kundgol, the Congress has fielded Kusumavathi Shivalli, the wife of former legislator and minister, C.S.Shivalli who died last month. The coalitions hope that a sympathy wave would take it past the finishing line countered by BJP’s candidature of S.I. Chikkanagoudara.

"According to HDFC Securities, an inverted bond yield curve can be a source of concern for a variety of reasons. Short-term bond yields are high perhaps due to an overly tight monetary policy.

The BJP has been the best performing party in terms of total seats won in the state over the past three general elections (since 2004). In the 2018 state assembly elections, the BJP won in constituencies beyond its traditional strongholds along the coast. All this suggests that the BJP should perform well in the state. However, the pre-poll alliance announced by the Congress and the JD(S) (Janata Dal Secular) could hurt its prospects. Had the Congress-JD(S) alliance existed in 2014, it would have secured 13 seats and brought down the BJP total to 15 (from 17).


The rest of South India, however, presents a far greater challenge for the BJP. Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are bastions of regional parties, where the BJP has struggled historically. These regional parties hold sway by appealing to local sensibilities, pride, culture and language, thereby denting the BJP’s nationalist appeal.

Palladium is a rare metal produced mostly in two countries, so it may not be possible to boost output immediately. More than 80% comes as a byproduct from nickel mining in Russia and platinum mining in South Africa, so supplies depend on the extraction level and investment in other minerals.

This certainly will trump some of the other initiatives such as the launch of stamps and the compilation of an anthology to commemorate the life of Gandhi.


Back in 1915, as you know, Gandhi travelled along this route in a third class railway carriage, as part of attempt to reacquaint himself with a country he’d left nearly two decades earlier. He started his journey in Pune, or Poona as it was known then, and then travelled this route.(Read more..)",0

But it was his unveiling of a new gaming-oriented graphics processor that elicited the biggest cheers Sunday night.

Daimler on Monday unveiled a new self-driving truck and Bosch and May Mobility separately unveiled their concepts for a driverless shuttle bus.",1
